          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><b>Methodological Diffractions for Graduate Education in Digital Visual Studies</b></p>
          <p><strong>By Aaron Beveridge and Laurie E. Gries</strong></p>
          <p>We want to begin this afterward with an expression of gratitude. Initially, the idea for this collection came to Laurie Gries in the middle of the night after her graduate class on Visual Rhetoric and Methodologies at the University of Colorado-Boulder in 2016. Gries had intended to write a full rhetorical biography of the Obama Hope image as a second monograph, but what if, Gries wondered, different scholars came to Obama Hope through a wide diversity of methods and methodologies. What more could we learn about Obama Hope and visual studies at large through a collective digital research project?</p>
          <p>Rather than immediately put out a national call for this collection, Gries decided to reach out to current graduate students in Communication at CU Boulder and past students in English at the University of Florida who she knew were undertaking compelling and innovative work with visual research. With students doing work with 3D printing, digital archiving, data science, augmented reality, media archaeology, and geosemiotics—Gries felt fortunate to have worked with so many inventive graduate students and felt confident their research could help expand the possibilities for digital visual studies. Their contributions to the collection would certainly not be easy; it required, after all, that contributors channel their own scholarly interests and investments toward a single object of study that they were not necessarily interested in. On the other hand, this digital project afforded each contributor the opportunity to experiment and play, to invent and take risks, and to push the boundaries of what we and others think are methodologically possible. In talking with potential authors about this collection, then, Gries simply asked that they propose a chapter that would not only deepen our knowledge of the Obama Hope image but, even more importantly, make an explicit methodological contribution to digital visual studies. What can you adapt or invent, Gries asked, that would model methodological innovation in action, that has potential to move digital visual studies forward in meaningful, productive directions? We are grateful that this question and project attracted the contributing author’s attention and appealed to their diverse interests.</p>
          <p>Due to the contributing authors’ varying ideas and goals, we believe this collection has resulted in a broad range of exciting methodological projects that each has potential to move digital visual studies forward in productive ways. Undoubtedly, of course, this collection is limited. Digital visual studies will benefit as more diverse bodies make more unique methodological contributions, drawing on their own perspectives, needs, and desires to both analyze and produce visual rhetorics with potential to impact academic and public affairs. We appreciate, as just a couple of examples, how Angela Haas has worked hard to recover the “digital and visual rhetorical sovereignty” of Indigenous communities and how Manan Ahmed et al pulled their collective energy to generate “Torn Apart/Separados,” a public digital humanities project that uses data visualizations to map out Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy in 2018 and more generally mass incarceration in the U.S. Following their lead, we advocate for more recovery of digital visual practices enacted in underrepresented culturally-specific contexts and more public projects to expose and confront contemporary issues of injustice. We especially want to advocate for scholars interested in digital visual studies to form collectives such as the Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research at Columbia University to develop lab spaces to further explore what it means to experiment in visual studies. While this collection has only offered a handful of experimental digital visual methodologies and methods, we hope to have inspired such scholarship by modeling the fruitful potentials that can be harnessed when we embrace methodological diversity and inventive play.</p>
          <p>Writing with the awareness that collections such as this are often taken up in graduate courses, the experimental approach taken up in this collection does raise, however, an important set of anticipated questions that we want to address in this afterward. When doing digital visual studies, how does one decide which methodology is best or most appropriate? Is it better to adapt traditional methods invented by others or get inventive and innovative to generate a method anew? And in the latter case--and especially because, as Joyce Carter (2015) notes, innovation is "a product of risk-taking with no guarantee of reward, and the very real possibility of failure"--is it really worth one’s time and energy to experiment, especially if a project has potential to fail?</p>
          <p>These questions have haunted Gries since her own graduate education. When she was defending her prospectus on the method of iconographic tracking, one of her outside readers for the prospectus (and a scholar who she greatly admires) asked her, what if you fail? In a respectful tone, but with naïve audacity, perhaps, she answered <em>so what</em>? Dissertations should be intellectual experiments and as a discipline, we should value projects that take risks and promote learning, even if failure occurs. Of course, this confidence in the face of failure is often born of a privileged perspective and position. Gries was 38 at the time--—confident as a white, married, cishet woman with a middle-class upbringing that if she did not land a job due to a failed project, it would be financially and emotionally okay. But too often fear of failure stifles innovation, and we feel strongly that we ought to be embracing risk taking and failure more, not less, for both the sake of individual learning and the sake of disciplinary knowledge.</p>
          <p>Questions about methodological risk taking and experimentation have also manifested in Aaron Beveridge’s own scholarly career. During his PhD, Beveridge faced tough methodological choices when he decided to focus his graduate work around data science, text mining, and natural language processing in a humanities discipline. While his mentors at UF showed enthusiastic stupport for his work with these methods, they also warned that it could be challenging to demonstrate that data science methods and methodologies would be accepted broadly as contributing to rhetorical scholarship. But despite the risk, Beveridge believed that teaching computers to read and write--procedurally--at scale would eventually show its own exigence (as it already has in many other humanities disciplines). While recent revelations about the changing nature of digital media further extend the pressing need for data-driven methods in studying digital networks—like Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, the unintended consequences of algorithmic filtering, the immense challenge of moderating digital content at a global scale, and the ongoing erasure of grassroots viral media by the surveillance economy—this exigence was not at all apparent when Beveridge started his PhD in 2013. So part of mitigating the risk of adopting data science methods required that Beveridge first explain why they could be useful to rhetoric and writing studies, while also working to improve their accessibility (MassMine), and finally, translate them for already-available writing studies and rhetoric methodologies. This, of course, would take (and is taking) years to develop. But given how quickly and disruptively technological change continues to happen, we argue that when it comes to digital visual studies, the risks of failure or the potential lack of acceptance for new methods are worth the time and effort it takes to experiment and adapt them for current and future methodologies.</p>
          <p>We realize, however, that unlike Gries and Beveridge, many graduate students do not have the luxury of pursuing their graduate work without an immense fear of failure—especially with institutionalized racisms at work, financial insecurities abound, and, among other factors, an overly competitive academic job market placing undue pressure on graduate students’ methodological choices. These factors are real and materially consequential, and we do not want to underplay them. Therefore, with hopes for offering a working heuristic for methodological invention and adoption, this afterward reviews the methodological choices made by the contributors to this collection. In considering how shifting technological infrastructures continue to constrain future methodological actions, we call for <em>methodological diffraction</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>Making Methodological Choices in Digital Visual Studies</strong></p>
          <p>Oft times, as in other areas of study, choice about methodology and method in digital visual studies relates directly to a specific visual artifact that piques our interest for some reason. For instance, for their chapter in this collection, Bratta and Gries work to deepen our understanding of how the emergent, vernacular, new media genre called Trumpicons are contributing to contemporary racial politics of circulation. They thus married critical genre studies and iconographic tracking to shed light on where Trumpicons are surfacing, what rhetorical activities they are becoming embroiled in, and how they are resisting white supremacist, post national logics (since they had already researched how they promulgated such logics in previous research). Sarah Beck, as just one other example, was interested in Obama Hope’s participation in the same sex marriage debate that was happening during Obama’s first presidential campaign and term. With previous interests in queer rhetoric and history, Beck thus married queer theory and rhetorical theory with archival research methods to trace Obama Hope’s fluctuating involvement in the cultural and legislative movement around same sex marriage alongside Obama’s shifting stances. In both these cases, then, specific questions about Obama Hope drove scholars to adapt already existing methodologies and methods for their distinct research needs.</p>
          <p>But sometimes, and perhaps more than often, methodological choice and innovation stems from more general questions about a phenomenon than specific questions about a visual artifact. For instance, Gries’ initial questions for <em>Still Life with Rhetoric</em> were: how do visual-material artifacts become rhetorical within time and space? How do images actually go viral? And what methodologies and methods are at our disposal to do such research? Gries chose the Obama Hope image because she knew it would afford her the opportunity to address these larger questions. This choice proved to be highly fruitful, exceeding her anticipations and expectations for both broad and in-depth research. But in actuality, her methodological choice of a new materialist approach derived from questions about rhetorical transformation and viral circulation while the invention of iconographic tracking derived from the lack of an explicit method at her disposal to find answers to such questions. Similarly, in this collection, Harry Archer and Emma Collins drew on the methodology of geosemiotics to invent a method they call virtual geosemiotics because they were interested in questions about context-depending meanings of images that circulate into different visual ecologies. They also wanted to know how they could identify the local meanings that images take on when researchers do not have the means to perform in situ research in a location to which they do not have physical access. In both these cases, then, choice of methodology and invention of method was driven not by a specific object of study but by broad phenomenological questions with uneasy research solutions.</p>
          <p>In the digital age especially, methodological choice, as many authors of this collection make clear, is also driven by research dilemmas that stem from the problems of technological innovation. As Blake Hallinan’s driving question makes clear, visual research dilemmas often arise as software and websites emerge and disappear: “If sites that are responsible for producing, storing, and circulating digitally-born artifacts that make a lasting impact on culture(s) disappear [and thus] scholars lose important primary sources that document an image’s historicity,” how can scholars adequately recover how images become significant players in the public sphere? Aaron Beveridge and Nicholas Van Horn, similarly, tackle problems associated with the loss of access to data. We can’t, they remind us, visualize or understand a history or dataset that we cannot access—or that could be deleted or lost if the data isn’t preserved. In order to address these technological-driven dilemmas, then, Hallinan turns to digital media archeology while Beveridge and Van Horn turn to macroscopic methodologies. Interestingly, for Beveridge and Van Horn, this has meant not only rethinking the methods and methodologies that drive their research activity, but also inventing the software to data science research. Like Ryan Omizo and Bill Hart-Davidson’s Hedge-O-Matic software, where rhetorical scholarship and software development are closely aligned, Beveridge and Van Horn thus produced MassMine, an open source research software designed to address issues of access, which they used to conduct research on Obama Hope tweets.</p>
          <p>Yet while methodological choice often stems from dilemmas with technological innovation, it also often emerges due to the affordances of technological innovation, especially its potential for civic engagement. Too often in visual studies, we perceive ourselves to be researchers of other’s rhetorical interventions into civic affairs. In doing so we miss important opportunities to make our own visual research intervene in public matters. Civic engagement requires rhetorical entanglement, a process that emerges only when our own scholarly productions have the opportunity to intermingle with other circulating discourses (Gries 2018). Research-creations have the ability to develop not just new theories but also new civic interventions. Modeling as such, Jacob Greene embraced rhetorical theory and set out to discover how digital platforms could be used to both analyze and produce civic rhetoric. He thus chose to explore how AR can function to both analyze and produce counterpublic remixes of widely circulated public images, and Greene challenges us to explore other means of digital visual production we might produce to put our own visual rhetoric into public circulation.</p>
          <p>While the methodological choices we have reviewed thus far stem more so from the questions, problems, or artifacts that inspired the work, methodological choice in digital visual studies also derives from curiosity about the potential of emergent methodologies themselves. What can, say, critical-making or glitching teach us about a specific visual artifact and visual studies at large? Taking such methodological route is perhaps the most difficult of all in that it requires total immersion with emerging design techniques, experimentation with unpredictable results, and deep methodological reflection to discover and identify a nascent practice’s possible contribution to digital visual studies. But as scholars in this collection demonstrate, such hard work can reap insightful rewards. Shannon Butts, for example, discovered through her own critical making of Obama Hope that 3D printing can “decenter normative ways of seeing in favor of diverse lived experiences.” Prioritizing difference and possibility via critical making approaches, she argues, can, in turn, push people to ask different questions, experiment with novel ideas, and better understand how our diverse senses shape embodied experiences. Kyle Bohunicky’s experimental play with glitching, on the other hand, models how the positive reframing of unintended consequences can lead to new directions for research that “formal analyses might be unable or even hesitant to address.” As he argues, such opening especially has potential to arise when we are open to a co-constitutive relationship with digital technologies in which we act as collaborative agents in creative-critical, rhetorical play.</p>
          <p>Finally, but certainly not least important, our answer as to how to decide which methodology is best or most appropriate—as well as whether to rely on traditional methods or invent anew even in the face of failure—also depends on the changing nature of the networks and technologies that define the space delimited as “digital.” For example, in 2009, when Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole DeVoss published “Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery,” they were helping to lay the groundwork for methodologies invested in viral media and remix culture, where the circulation model for many digital networks was based on user-sharing, weak ties, and reverse-chronological distributions of digital artifacts. Yet, that same year, Facebook replaced users’ reverse-chronological newsfeeds with algorithmically filtered content, and by 2016 this became the default circulation model for many of the largest social networks—like Twitter and Instagram. This fundamental shift in how digital media are delivered and circulated has methodological consequences that we are just beginning to understand. For example, at the end of <em>Still Life with Rhetoric</em>, which was published in 2015, Gries explains that one of the contributing reasons for visual things “going viral” is the designer/author utilizing “distribution strategies [that] make a thing easily accessible to a mass audience” (285). Like Ridolfo and DeVoss, these strategies focus largely on composing, design, production, and remix methods that maximize an artifact’s contagious potential—its mobility and likelihood of generating large-scale affective responses within and across multiple networks. While these strategies remain nonetheless vital for digital composers, and should not be given any less credence in digital visual studies, their analytical value in understanding <em>why</em> something has “gone viral” has less relevance today than we may surmise. Today, while composition and distribution are still highly important, chances for broad circulation have more to do with how well the designer/author has aligned the delivery of their artifact with an algorithm’s underlying processes for calculating an artifact’s relevance for other users in the network. In other words, the move away from a reverse-chronological circulation model requires that we change the way we study the digital artifacts that circulate within digital networks. The very nature of how things move and circulate within digital networks has changed—replacing contagion effects with network effects that are driven by the attendant data that influence the filters and algorithms that now control what users see within digital networks.</p>
          <p>In light of such changes in technological infrastructure, scholars doing digital visual studies will thus likely be pressured to keep inventing methods anew to keep up with how digital visual artifacts impact and interface with culture. In recognition that methodological tradition as well as reflection are important, then, we propose <em>methodological diffraction</em> as we move forward with digital visual studies. We are thinking here of Karen Barad’s transdisciplinary diffractive meta-methodology and her call to “disrupt the widespread reliance on an existing optical metaphor—namely, reflection—that is set up to look for homologies and analogies between separate entities.” As Barad explains, “diffraction” is not concerned with “homologies but attends to specific material entanglements” (88). The problem with specific material entanglements—whether digital or physical or (more likely) something in between—is that they are under no obligation to conform to our preferred methodologies and methods for investigating their consequentiality. For example, as mentioned above, many circulation studies scholars of new media still often assume the early design of social networks (~2008-2015) in which reverse-chronologies of user-generated content magnify the viral potential of grassroots movements and the networking capacity of remix culture—the humanities saw immense promise in the democratic possibilities emerging from this circulation model. However, that model has been replaced in many digital networks by data-driven technologies that distribute content based on black boxed statistical calculations of “engagement” or “relevance” for groups of users. In other words, again, this fundamental techno-cultural change requires that we adjust our methods and methodologies to better understand their effects/affects on the delivery, circulation, and consequentiality of visual artifacts.</p>
          <p>If we are to remain truly open to finding the best answers to difficult methodological choices, then, our choices must be located less in disciplinary pronouncements and in entrenched protections for established theories and methods than in paying close attention to the changing nature of digital networks. This may be an unsatisfying answer to the question that frames this afterward, but when scholars remain too devoted to long-standing methodologies and methods, they risk failing to invent new method and/or heavily adapt previous methods that can better help them visualize the changing nature of visual data at play in digital networks. If anything, when it comes to digital visual research, “playing it safe” with one’s methodological choices may be riskier than attempting to forge new ways of doing digital visual studies.</p>
          <p>Our call to action for this afterward is thus to encourage scholars to pay close attention to specific material entanglements of digital networks—to, as Barad says, meet them halfway—and to test a wide range of methods and methodologies in studying those material specificities. When it comes to digital visual research—where the nature(s) of digital environments often change more quickly than we can make sense of them—our choices must be more directly connected to the programs, systems, algorithms, and business models that drive the development and the daily operation of digital networks. This is especially imperative because the complex reciprocity between technological change and cultural change will only continue to produce techno-cultural shifts that challenge our desire to establish and extend methodological norms for digital visual studies. The methods and methodologies forwarded in this collection could, for example, become obsolete within 5 years. In fact, they may already be outdated by the time you are reading this collection. If anything has proved true of digital networks, it is a fool’s errand to try to predict how such complex posthuman systems/technologies will change over time. Therefore, as digital visual culture is always-evolving, we cannot help but embrace methodological adaption, experimentation, and invention.</p>
          <p>While such methodological evolution is not without risk, we believe this to be one of the most exciting and wonderful aspects of the work we do—especially as digital visual studies scholars. We thus encourage upcoming scholars to get closer to the metal, to work hard to pay attention to newly emerging material specificities, and to let their methodological choices be sparked by their own creativity and desire in response to constantly shifting techno-culture change. This does not mean that we should forget our histories, traditions, and methodological trajectories—these no doubt remain influential on our choices—but they should not carry so much inertia that they keep us from seeing and studying the changing nature of visual digital media. Take a risk—it’s probably less risky than playing it safe.</p>

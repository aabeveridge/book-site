          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><b>Preserving and Visualizing Circulation Data</b></p>
          <p>Data visualization—the act of collecting data, processing it, and making sense of it visually through statistical methods—is a growing area of interest for rhetoric and writing studies more generally (Beveridge, Mueller, Omizo &amp; Hart-Davidson, Wolfe), and for digital visual studies in particular (Gallagher and Devoss, Gries). As pervasive and ubiquitous digital objects, data visualizations are embedded in everything from websites and news blogs to mobile applications and virtual dashboards. A data visualization can be as simple as an embedded image that compares categorical data—like a pie chart or a bar graph—or data visuals can be generated in a dynamic digital interface, allowing people to interact with the data and select how they are compared, the type of graph or chart that will be used, and the time/date range that will frame the visual comparison/description. From a design standpoint, a data visualization can be as basic as creating a graph or chart in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, using hand coded data from an observational study, or a data visualization can be as complex as calculating network-wide trends for an entire social network—in real time—to display lists of the hottest topics and #hashtags for various regions/locations/networks. Given the vast diversity of types and possibilities for designing data visualizations, one thing remains true for all of them: data visualizations are only as effective as their underlying data and the methods/methodologies used to make them.</p>
          <p>This point may seem obvious or trite, but as this chapter will show, it is a mistake to assume the pervasive ubiquity of data visuals equates to the same level of ubiquitous access for researchers who want to study the underlying data and processing methods that power those visuals. Data has become “the new oil”—a popular metaphor demonstrating the powerful capabilities of data driven methods, but the oil metaphor also forces us to consider the harmful pollutants these methods have introduced digital networks. Because of their shifting status as a resource of value—both economically and culturally—data visualizations maintain an inverse relationship with the underlying data that informs their making. In other words, as data visualizations have become more wide-spread and easier to produce, their underlying data have become financially lucrative and therefore less accessible. For example, Twitter’s data reselling and licensing (allowing other companies to access and analyze their network data) is now a primary source of revenue—representing up to $117 million in annual revenue for the company, and over 12% of its total annual revenue. But, if you consider the fact that Twitter’s data is what powers its programs and algorithms—the systematic delivery of advertisements to users newsfeeds—then Twitter’s data actually accounts for the vast majority of its $908 million of annual revenue (Dignan).</p>
          <p>The lack of accessibility for digital data presents many challenges for digital visual studies. Without adequate access to the underlying data, academic researchers have a difficult time studying the harmful contaminants emerging from data-driven methods: bots, click farms, echo chambers, information cascades, the unintended consequences of algorithmic filtering, the surveillance economy, privacy infringements, and fake news/misinformation campaigns. To be clear, we <em>do not</em> see these challenges as essentially disqualifying data-driven methods for digital visual research. In fact, quite the opposite. Much like the classical formulation of rhetoric, the methods emerging from data science can function as both poison and remedy, depending on the methodology that frames their use. Just as data-driven methods can be used to fuel targeted marketing and large-scale digital manipulation, these same methods also provide powerful tools for observing, understanding, and countering digital pollutants listed above.</p>
          <p>For example, in 2015 Eunsong Kim published <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-politics-of-trending">“The Politics of Trending,”</a> showing how Twitter’s trend monitoring algorithms were ignoring—and potentially suppressing—trends associated with #blacklivesmatter. To conduct this study, Kim used a data analytics tool called Topsy—a web application providing free trend analytics for networks like Twitter. Kim used Topsy’s analytics to investigate why trends like #Ferguson were not appearing on Twitter’s trending lists for the United States, even though Topsy’s analytics clearly show #Ferguson produced far more tweets than other trends on Twitter’s trending list. As Kim explains, her findings do not prove that Twitter was intentionally suppressing social movement trends, as her results likely indicate an unintended consequence of Twitter’s algorithmic design for identifying trends in their network. However, the more problematic legacy of Kim’s research is this: it is no longer possible to replicate Kim’s analysis.</p>
          <p>The opening section of this chapter, “Mergers and Acquisitions,” explains why data preservation and access remain key issues for expanding the use of data-driven methods in digital visual research. If we are to make use of data-driven tools to understand and address many of the new challenges facing digital networks—but also to study the circulation and rhetorical consequentiality of digital visual artifacts <em>at scale</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>—then we must continue to address the problem of data accessibility for digital networks. The final two sections of this chapter (“Preservation” and “Visualization”) also contribute to the application of data-driven methods in digital visual studies—and to Obama Hope research—by showing readers how we archived, preserved, and visualized XXX 14,588 XXX Tweets (referred to as “Obama Hope Tweets” throughout the article) discussing Shepard Fairey’s Obama Hope image. The “Preservation” section shows researchers how to preserve and access this and other Tweet archives for their own digital visual projects, and these activities ensure that researchers will be able replicate the analytics and visuals produced by other scholars—for peer review and for collaborators and future scholars who wish to build on that work. This enables researchers to test and explore these same data in new ways, but this work also contributes to important intellectual movements, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">open data</a> and <a href="https://dataforgood.ca/">data for good</a>.</p>
          <p>The “Data Visualization” section of this chapter visualizes the data associated with the Obama Hope Tweets to provide a macroscopic history of Fairey’s Obama Hope image—from 2008 to 2016. While it is important to remember that this is only a history according to those items that Twitter users chose to discuss, post about, like, favorite, or retweet, this history provides a macroscopic description of the public conversation surrounding Fairey’s iconic image.</p>

            <li id="fn1" class="footnotes"><p><b>1. </b>I say <em>at scale</em> to indicate data/data processing issues that are indicative of our current model of global circulation, which operates among multiple, overlapping digital networks. In other words, doing circulation studies at scale requires toolsets that are capable of working with massive datasets that allow us to describe and make sense of circulation as it currently operates. Such a claim does not pit human research methods against data-driven methods, because the two are not in competition—they operate at different scales. Data-driven methods are for datasets too large for any human to read/analyze/understand in a reasonable amount of time (which is why they call it “big” data). For example, making sense of patterns in a social network posts for a network like Twitter—in real time—cannot be done by humans because the data is coming in too fast, at too high a rate. <a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>

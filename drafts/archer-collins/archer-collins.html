<p>Geolocating Obama Hope: Using Virtual Geosemiotics to Find Context Dependent Meaning in Obama Hope</p>
<p>In <em>Still Life with Rhetoric, </em>Gries traces the circulation of Shepard Fairey’s, now iconic, Obama Hope image and explores how the image spread throughout the world in a variety of different mediums. Using her method of iconographic tracking, Gries’ work is extremely helpful in understanding the national and global influence of the image. Yet although the book features some longer explanation of local uptakes of the Obama Hope image, the book generally focuses on the broad strokes of its circulation and transformation. Our chapter seeks to zoom in and take a close look at localized uses of the Obama Hope image through a method we call virtual geosemiotics. While iconographic tracking privileges movement and transformation in regard to a single image, this method slows the motion of circulation to see how a particular sign serves a particular function in a particular place as it interacts with other signs around it. We are particularly interested in what kinds of signification and function the Obama Hope image takes on in murals found in Larose, Louisiana and in Orgosolo, Italy. Whereas Obama Hope communicates a sense of positive forward momentum in certain contexts, in Larose and Orgosolo, the image takes an ominous turn<em>.</em></p>
<p>Drawing on the methodology of geosemiotics, this chapter will introduce a method for accessing context dependent meaning of an object as it circulates into different visual ecologies. We generate case level arguments regarding how Obama Hope is used and intoned by differing motive forces in both Louisiana and Sardinia. Whereas other geosemiotic studies have used traditional ethnographic observation to make their claims (Bick and Chiper; Denis and Pontille), we have improvised a virtual geosemiotic method using online mapping technology. For students and scholars of the image and its circulation, tools such as Google Street View can offer potential avenues for gathering information regarding an image’s placement. With more information about the visual scene of which an image is a part, digital visual studies scholars can produce richer claims regarding the nature of rhetorical circulation itself.</p>
<p>As we discuss in more detail below, virtual geosemiotics, as we imagine it in this chapter, takes advantage of visual semiotics and place semiotics as well as digital technologies such as Google Street View to access the dialogicity that Obama Hope is implicated within, both in Larose, Lousiana and Orgosolo, on the island of Sardinia to the west of Italy. In doing such research, we aim to demonstrate how virtual geosemiotics as a method can enhance our understanding of how place contributes to the meaning of communicative artifacts. As evident in the spatial humanities, digital tools such as Google Earth and Google Maps are becoming more and more popular for doing research across disciplines. For instance, in human geography, De Vries et al. have used Google Maps to measure the social attractiveness of landmarks in the Netherlands based upon tagging behaviors of locals and visitors. We argue that digital tools such as Google Maps, Google Street View, and the practice of geotagging across platforms can also be useful to digital visual studies, especially for projects such as this one that are concerned with how murals and other visual artifacts are shaped by their emplacement.</p>
<p>The Obama Hope image surfaces in a variety of media in its variety of locations throughout the world. We have settled upon the two murals in Louisiana and Orgosolo, in part because mural as a medium lends itself to semiotics of place, due to their inscription upon physical walls of the city, and to visual semiotics due to their composition as visual forms. But we are also interested in these particular murals due to their function as sites of resistance. Prior studies in rhetoric regarding murals have focused on the ability of the medium to destabilize hegemonic spaces. Darrel Enck-Wanzer, for instance, describes murals in El Barrio/East Harlem as “tactical interventions in the neoliberal metropolis” (p. 346). The Nuyorican murals are a part of an ensemble of material culture that espouse identity and resist complicity with dominant Anglo-American society by “generating identity possibilities” in the metropolis (p. 361). Enck-Wanzer also observes the use of murals by corporate agents to appeal to the Nuyorican regional aesthetic in order to garner their business. Needless to say that the mural as a medium can be hijacked for the needs of dominant interests but as Ferrell et al. argue, the battle for meaning between social movements and late capitalism is ongoing with victory never total. The battleground itself, the city walls, remain as a site of ongoing contestation.</p>
<p>Mural and graffiti are so context dependent that to define them and render them as static objects would belie their nature as temporal phenomena inscribed, only for a time, on the urban landscape. Street art may be a better term to capture the fleeting essence of these forms. In this vein, Gillian Jein investigates the Parisian <em>banlieues</em>, experiencing the concurrent processes of gentrification, displacement, and segregation along the lines of class and race. In the Parisian context, the street art Jein analyses claims its own place in a space that is being restructured by government policy, which has inspired a rise in property values, and a bourgeois redistribution of the sensible. Following the work of Jacques Ranciere, Jein suggests that street art forms an interruption in the:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>police order, through its material performance of the ephemeral and aesthetic interruption of the smoothness of public architectures. It calls on the viewer to stop and look, creating pause in the flow of orderly departures and destinations that cause us very often to miss the cumulative presences that make urban space a public place. (p. 103)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, murals and graffiti tend towards resisting dominant discourses or police orders to provide spaces of everyday life that may offer a pause from the grinding gears of the hegemonic order. The two murals investigated here are similar in that, as you will see, they challenge a commonplace reading of the Obama Hope image by foregrounding imagery that resists the discourse of the global and regional metropole. As such, these murals make for important foci for learning more about the Obama Hope image’s complex rhetorical life.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we argue that using virtual geosemiotics to study these two murals can help reveal the changing valences of the Obama Hope image as it travels across the world. As a methodology, geosemiotics provides researchers with analytic categories for observing local dynamics in visual communication, but when twinned with a critical sensibility borne from the rhetorical tradition, the methodology can facilitate a judgment [<em>krisis</em>] on the relations it discovers. After all, as potential mediators of images in everyday life, people ought to be able to make a judgment regarding whether they should share or promote certain images in certain locales. To achieve this perspective on Obama Hope, we consider some general geosemiotic principles before introducing our own research method and geosemiotic analysis. In our analysis, the stable character of the artifact is challenged, and the mobile and mutable characteristics of the object’s rhetorical life are celebrated. But in addition, by reimagining geosemiotic methods, we seek room for critical judgment on the deployments of the Obama Hope image in the indexable world.</p>
<p><strong>Geosemiotics</strong></p>
<p>Geosemiotics as envisioned by Scollon and Scollon, includes three interconnected fields of inquiry: social interaction orders, visual semiotics and place semiotics. The interaction order is a concept borrowed from Erving Goffman’s (<em>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</em>; “Behavior in Public Places”; <em>Relations in Public</em>) studies of behavior in public spaces. These classic works in nonverbal communication provide a social spine for the study of geosemiotics, which assumes that places are characterized by the social interactions that take place therein. Additionally, by observing behavior in place relating to sense of time, perceptual spaces, interpersonal distances, and personal fronts, the geosemiotician can establish a sense of how signs will be read by people in the space, and how certain behaviors will operate as indexical signs for other actors in the space. The next phase of analysis in a typical geosemiotic study takes into account the visual semiotics of images that index the “world in which they are placed” and “how social actors index these images which are so abundant” (Scollon &amp; Scollon, p. 84). Finally, in terms of place semiotics, the place itself, whether built up or wild, must be analyzed for the qualities that interact with the social and visual signage that are in constant dialogue.</p>
<p>Geosemiotics, as you can see here, is preoccupied with the indexable world. Whereas, symbolic meaning definitively exceeds the resources available in the physical scene, indexical meaning resides firmly in the interaction of signifying elements; the pointing to or away from, the positioning over and above, the depiction of the local or otherwise. This principle of indexicality opens up the potential for multiple readings of the Obama Hope image as its meaning is not stable across different landscapes and communities. Furthermore, the meaning of Obama Hope does not reside in the image but in the interaction between it and the signs that surround it, whether in the form of localizable social interaction orders, and/or other images in the landscape. This principle--termed dialogicity by Scollon and Scollon -- is defined simply as the assumption that “all signs operate in aggregate” (p. 205). The authors suggest that there is a double meaning to dialogicity: that the sign, when placed, references a specific discourse that informs that placement, but once placed, the sign interacts with other discourses in the forms of interaction orders and other place-based signage. In other words, dialogicity ensures that the sign, once out in the world, is no longer under the sole semiotic sovereignty of the placer. That sign is now part of an ecology of signs.</p>
<p>In this spirit of geosemiotic inquiry, Bick and Chiper analyze how the Nike swoosh symbol is taken up in the different contexts of Romania and Haiti. The authors conduct their comparative study after spending time in each location on ethnographic immersions in the tradition of cultural anthropology. Resonances with our project are found in their approach to the semiotics of their places as typified by their fringe status on the edges of Western capitalism. Bick and Chiper suggest that the Nike swoosh in the outer reaches of the American empire, is a sign that offers a u-topic break from the everyday life of local concerns. The authors even argue that because the Nike swoosh is available to all in Haiti and Romania, its logic as a purveyor of capitalism is undermined. A sort of defiant joy in the production and consumption of the symbol exists completely aside from its totemic status as a signifier of the mega corporation. As such, we follow in the spirit of Bick and Chiper when we look for meanings that are emplaced, and unanticipated by the designs of Shepard Fairey. Yet whereas Bick and Chiper based their claims on extended periods of ethnographic immersion in Haiti and Romania, we produce our claims by navigating the virtual spaces of Google Maps, Google Street View, and related geotagged visual artifacts.</p>
<p>In experimenting with virtual geosemiotics, we are not suggesting that virtual methods are more favorable for conducting ethnographic fieldwork, but we do argue that they deserve serious examination as an increasingly common way of experiencing spaces from afar. In acknowledging the staccato rhythms of Street View image updates and geotagged images online, we also acknowledge that our method is not ethnographic in any traditional sense. Our methodological commitment is not a faithful representation of the community’s intentions—rather, we analyze the online image as a prism through which we can see our object of interest circulate into place and gain new characteristics. The resulting distance—rather than being a hindrance to faithful research—facilitates a critical judgment of an image’s circulation and context-dependent meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Geosemiotics</strong></p>
<p>Virtual geosemiotics is a research method that uses geo-spatial technologies to locate and study images that take on context-dependent meanings in specific locales across the globe. In terms of our research process, we intially scoured Gries’s Obama Hope image data set to select geographically and content-diverse murals for our case studies. With over 1000 images in the data set and over a dozen murals, our choices were not meant to be exhaustive or even representative of the archive, but rather serve as case studies to illustrate how virtual geosemiotics might help expand our knowledge of the local, indexable, visual world and Obama Hope’s place in it. Broadly, we used geo-spatial technologies (GST) such as Google Earth and Google Maps, web searches of various media coverage, and reverse images searches to gain a comprehensive, virtual view of our selected Obama Hope murals in their original place. Using GST, particularly the street view on Google Maps, we were able to locate the exact coordinates of both murals. This technology also allowed us to explore the area, neighborhood and town to help contextualize the ecology of local signs.</p>
<p>The following emplaced images are both remixes of Obama Hope composed in the medium of paint. <em>Obama-Berlusconi-Progress-Process</em> is a mural painted directly on to a wall in Orgosolo, Sardinia. Whereas <em>Obama What Now?</em> was painted onto a movable frame and displayed on the side of the Southern Sting Tattoo Shop in Larose, Louisiana. Both placements of these murals are suggestive of the tensions between the political periphery and center in the national context of the United States, and in the terms of the Italian state governing Sardinia from the mainland. The images and their geophysical placement offer scholars doing digital visual studies opportunities to examine the differing intonations and political valences that emerge as an image circulates and undergoes remix.</p>
<p>In the course of investigating Larose and Orgosolo, we found a shifting semiotic aggregate, or concentration of localized meaning, the more we probed links in the data. The videos that accompany this chapter show how extended time spent navigating Google Street View reveals new indexical relations in the case of Orgosolo. And furthermore, Instagram became an invaluable resource when exposing the contradictory and sometimes troubling images emanating from the Southern Sting Tattoo Shop in Larose. Although images are always fragmentary and selective, the digital cuttings that we amassed during this investigative work were all glimpses—rather than immersions—of signifying ecologies. The accompanying videos show viewers how our research strategies unfold by using screen capture to put the viewer in the position of the virtual geosemiotic researcher. The medium of video is better able to capture these procedures that although are replicable, would be augmented depending on the online content available for a given case.</p>
<p>The work of contextualizing an appearance of Obama Hope relies on the critic divining indexical links between images that are discovered in the online representational space. Indexical links also exist in the form geotags either using Google Maps or other platforms such as Instagram. Indexicality exists then in both the world rendered indexable by visual linking work of critics, and the virtual world that has been doing indexing work in the form of imagery that is indexed by the data rich practice of geotagging. We believe that this virtual method offer a productive opportunity for digital visual scholars, particularly those interested in emplacement, to study more signs within local semiotic ecologies.</p>
<p>In this study we advocate for the use of virtual methods as a starting point for investigations that would otherwise call for <em>in situ</em> field work. In rhetorical field methods writ large, techniques range from interviewing key persons, observing action in the scene, photographing, writing extensive fieldnotes, using the critic’s body as a mediator of the physical environment and as a recording device for logging affective experiences. One could characterize studies in their commitments to (a): a community, as with studies that resemble ethnographies complete with <em>in situ</em> interviews that examine the interpretations of people (Na’puti; Pezzullo); (b): a commitment to space and its affective properties: these studies may not include any interviews or any interpretations other than the critic’s, but they do attend to the materialities immanent to the scene in a direct fashion (Blair; Dickinson); and (c), virtual methods that seek to discover the affordances of digital techniques for the researcher. The commitment in virtual methods is not to a community or a material space, but a new space of representations that comprise a seemingly real, photographic world, and yet still offer up a particular way of seeing environments.</p>
<p><strong>Larose, Louisiana Case Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1. Video revealing the virtual geosemiotic method for the Obama What Now? mural in Larose, Louisiana. This video previews the potential of using street level imagery in coordination with other geotagged images from online news and social media platforms. </strong></p>
<p>For nearly three months after the Deep Horizon oil rig exploded, oil rushed onto the shores of the Gulf (Eliott). In the wake of this disaster, two tattoo artists in the coastal town of Larose, Louisiana began to paint murals to voice their frustration (Pitre). Bobby Pitre and Eric Guidry made the front outside wall of their tattoo shop their own art gallery. A few months after the initial explosion, as the economic, social, and political repercussions continued to plague coastal communities, Pitre and Guidy painted three side-by-side murals. The mural on the left features a white tower on a black backdrop. The text on the tower reads “Louisiana Water Tower.” The word water has been crossed out and replaced with the word oil in red dripping paint. On the right, a mural with a green outline of the Southeastern United States is in the background. In the foreground, a skeletal figure draped in a black robe leans their hands over the Gulf Coast and looks back at the audience. “BP” is written on the figure’s robe and the sentence “You Killed Our Gulf/Our Way of Life” is written at the top of the mural. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 2: Guidry and Pitre’s murals. Photograph by McClelland.</strong></p>
<p>The middle mural is a play on Shepard Fairy’s Obama Hope image.  Guidry explained this remix of Obama Hope like this: I painted President Obama's campaign portrait and made it into my own creation. Instead of the words "hope" or "change", I inserted "WHAT NOW?" across his forehead with his entire being surronded [<em>sic</em>] by question marks. (Pitre). The mural features the same three quarters profiled bust of President Obama as Fairey’s image. The color scheme is very similar with a wash of reds, whites and blues over Obama’s face and the background. Obama is adorned the same blazer, shirt and tie in the mural and Fairey’s original image. There are, however, a few notable differences. </p>
<p>First, Obama is not wearing a lapel pin with his signature campaign logo. Second, because the mural was painted by hand instead of traced, some of the face proportions are a little skewed. In this mural representation of Obama, his nose and eyes are a little bit bigger, his face is a bit leaner and longer, and his eyes darker. Despite these differences, the depiction still clearly evokes an image of the president and Fairey’s original Obama Hope image. Third, and perhaps most striking, the word hope has been removed from the original image and replaced with the words “what now” and 13 question marks have been painted on and around Obama’s face. By moving text from the bottom of the image to the top, according to Kress and van Leeuwen’s (<em>Reading Images</em>; <em>Multimodality</em>) typology, the muralists change the textual message from the real position to the ideal position. The initial Obama hope image from Fairey positioned the word “hope” in the real position, perhaps in an attempt to portray this message of hope as realistic to voters. Hope is no longer real for the gulf coast residents that have been devastated by the BP oil spill. Instead, ideally, they want action from the federal government to restore their way of life. Thus, the text changes both wording and placement to reflect that desire. This textual move perhaps mirrors Guidry’s internal motivation for the piece explained by him as “I now see our president in a different light, he is not the same person I rooted for in the presidential election” (Pitre). From Guidry’s perspective, Obama can no longer be decorated with the message of real hope. Guidry’s disappointment in his response to the Gulf Coast crisis is reflected in the textual change and spatial move of the words in the remix of Obama hope. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 3: Southern Sting Tattoo Parlor, Larose, Louisiana.</strong></p>
<p>Scollon and Scollon explain “decontextualized semiotics makes no reference to the place in the world where the signs appear within the picture, image, or textual frame” (p. 146). Fairey’s Obama hope image, in its original version, makes no reference to the world around it, and thus its meaning is relatively consistent across contexts. However, both the placement and changes made to the image in the Louisiana mural creates a localized semiotics system and meaning for the sign. If the image of Obama emblazoned with “what now” across his forehead was placed on a tattoo shop in Chicago around the same time, the sign would not be referencing the BP oil spill. The mural’s place on the wall, in between two other murals with political commentary on the oil, and its geographic location in a small coastal town heavily impacted by the crisis, help construct the meaning of the sign. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 5: Screen grab of Google Maps representation of the intersection of the Bayou Lafourche and Gulf Intracostal Waterway.</strong></p>
<p>Pitre’s tattoo shop is located at the corner of 6th and Main in Larose, Louisiana. Google street view allows us to explore the area more thoroughly. The shop is located just off the Bayou Lafourche, which connects to the Gulf of Mexico. At Port Fourchon, where the Bayou meets the gulf, fishing for shrimp and oysters was a thriving industry. In the immediate aftermath of the Horizon explosion, fishing was shutdown completely. Five years later, those industries had still not completely recovered (Elliot). Guidry explains,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might not seem like any regular day tattoo artist would be affected by this oil spill, but the truth is we are being affected the same as everyone else. We depend on our shrimpers, crabbers, oyster men, oil workers and anyone else who works in these fields to make the money that supplies us a living from this art form.” (Pitre).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>The tattoo shop was geographically, economically and socially implicated in the oil crisis of 2010 and their mural was as an addition to the local semiotic system. </p>
<p>Tattoo shops operate as an alternative, periphery space and Pitre’s shop is no different. Google street view’s history function reveals that from 2009 to 2013 the shop was adorned with different murals around the outside walls of the building. Although tattoo shops are often on a periphery of social life, they are not always explicitly political in the sense of the electoral process. However, in the case of Pitre’s shop, a political space was produced by the act of placing murals on the shop’s outside walls. Where <em>alternative</em> culture was once understood as the provenance of the left, in 2010, with Barack Obama in office, alternatives started brewing from other political hues. The Tea Party, and later the alt-right would lay claim to being counter culture movements. Although <em>Obama What Now?</em> cannot be directly associated with these movements, the semiotic aggregate of the Southern Sting skews to the political right.</p>
<p>The distorted form of Obama Hope on the outside of the Tattoo shop generates an encounter between the urbane President Obama and the toxicity of the oil spill. Larose sits on the end of the road to the Gulf. The tattoo shop qualifies the space by expressing the nightmare of the spill and the inadequacy of hope in its wake. This particular site is the end of the road for hope.</p>
<p>Henri Lefebvre, when speaking of spatial architectonics, talks of “an intelligence of the body” (p. 174) that co-constructs geometry with the available material elements of the space that the body occupies. One might think of a spider constructing a web using different anchorage points and its own body to realize the possibilities of its own occupation. Using the spider example, spatial architectonics appears to be a concept of physics and biology, but one can extend the notion to consider social relations and politics. Indeed, to think of space in any terms other than social relations, is to consider space as merely surface, a cardinal mistake for the geographer Doreen Massey. The mural, positioned as it is, not only expresses a mood or feeling, it also territorializes a relationship and leaves a gesture, trace, and mark of the political. In other words, the tattoo shop <em>is</em> politics on the periphery, it is a testament to bodies co-constructing their own local geometries, literally using their skin as canvas, and extending those sensibilities onto the physical material walls of Larose, Louisiana. Pitre’s shop offers an answer to the question: where am I? Where the answer exceeds the coordinates of a surface and provides an image that orients the individual to the politics of the Gulf.</p>
<p>The mural tells us that very little is being done by the federal government, despite the catastrophic scope of the spill. The mural also tells us that the people of Larose have very little means to communicate to political power what they need. The temptation for the critic doing digital visual studies is to be content with <em>Obama What Now?</em> as an act of resistance to contamination and federal inaction. But acts of resistance contain their own cross references and political valences that skew one way or another. In the case of the Southern Sting the references begin to spiral into territory that is not simply ecofriendly in its political disposition. As demonstrated in the Larose video above, local meaning is found in the iconography of the Confederacy and twentieth century German militarism. The crisis of Deepwater Horizon was an opportunity to redraw a relationship with the metropolitan center, which happened to be occupied by a centrist liberal. The dialogic effect of these local references amounts to an embrace of anti-liberalism with the question <em>What Now?</em> posed to arguably the United States’ greatest liberal figure by a tattoo artist who just happens to wear a German World War One battle helmet from time to time (see Larose video).</p>
<p><strong>Orgosolo Case Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 6. Video demonstrating the virtual geosemiotic method in operation for the Obama and Berlusconi mural in the town of Orgosolo. This video is intended to be an introductory snapshot of a method in process rather than an exhaustive account of all procedures of discovery and interpretation. </strong></p>
<p>Orgosolo is a town of less than 5,000 people in central Sardinia. Sardinia sits beneath Corsica and north of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea to the west of Italy. When it comes to murals, Orgosolo is an unusual town as there is a profusion of the artform that is at least comparable with Berlin and its graffiti (see Heinsohn). Murals in Orgosolo portray the everyday life of rural workers; scenes of dwelling are frequent with the women of the town featured prominently. There are also depictions of events in the town’s history, the history of the left in Italy, and other events of global significance.</p>
<p>Obama Hope exists in Orgosolo as one half of a mural that depicts Silvio Berlusconi on the right half with word PROCESS underneath his portrait. Berlusconi’s face wears gritted teeth in contrast to Obama’s noble serenity on the left that is anchored by the words PROGRESS. A question lingering over this image is whether the juxtaposition of the two leaders posits a contrast, celebrating one at the expense of the other, or a claim of similarity, that the two leaders are two sides of the same coin. Can geosemiotic analysis help narrow the interpretation?</p>
<p><img src="media/image5.jpg" style="width:6in;height:4in" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 7: Via Antonio Gramsci, Orgosolo, Sardinia. Photograph retrieved from escalator.wordpress.com.</strong></p>
<p>One geotagged picture of the mural was taken in July 2014 (escalator.wordpress.com), whilst another dates the mural at December 2011 (123RF.COM). Another photograph of the mural on Instragram is copyrighted by Isabetta Loi in 2016. We can reasonably claim that the mural has been visible on the wall for 5 years between 2011 and 2016.</p>
<p>One useful strategy for tracking down this image was searching Instagram for the geotag #orgosolo. From the Instagram pictures alone, we were able to make out that this particular wall is also used to paste wishes in the form of posters to the recently deceased with messages and usually a picture of a saint, the Virgin Mary, or Jesus Christ. In the images at our disposal, we find that these messages are pasted below the mural so as not to disturb its image, in spite of the fact that the bereavement messages are of a very different tenor to the mural and of greater local significance.</p>
<p>As we stated in the first part of this chapter, dialogicity is the principle that “all signs operate in aggregate” (p. 205). In other words, once placed out in the world, a sign gains its meaning through its position in relation to other signs. To investigate dialogicity, we examine the signs that surround our sign of interest, the Obama and Berlusconi mural. With this aim in mind, we took to the streets using Google Street View. Google has the town of Orgosolo comprehensively recorded in the form of street view photographs and our visual analysis was aided by the qualities of the narrow winding streets of the small town in the mountainous region. Such streets enabled the Google photography to yield high resolution images of murals on the sides of buildings.</p>
<p><img src="media/image6.png" style="width:6in;height:2.29931in" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 8: The wall in question on Via Antonio Gramsci.</strong></p>
<p>The location is on Via Antonio Gramsci and the closest mural is that of Gramsci himself in red and black with the black shrouding half of his face, the red half features minimal detail with only one eye, half a nose and half a mouth depicted. The text reads <em>Terra Gramsci</em>: Land of Gramsci. Only a few yards away sits a mural of Ernesto Che Guevara surrounded by white figures bearing red flags protesting against war. One long-haired figure in denim holds a sign reading “not in my name.” His penis hangs out of his jeans and a dismembered hand reaches for the member in question. Beneath his crotch sits a round peace symbol. The image appears to commemorate the loose coalition of leftist groups calling for peace in the 1960s and 1970s. Rolston translates the text on this image as “Che’s last letter to his sons […]: Above all, always be capable of feeling deeply in your heart any injustice, committed against anyone, anywhere in the world. This is the most beautiful quality of a revolutionary” (p. 91). The text brings the grotesque image of the hippie protestor into relief and confirms Roland Barthes argument regarding the importance of captions anchoring the meaning of images.</p>
<p><img src="media/image7.png" style="width:6in;height:2.09306in" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 9: Che Guevara mural</strong></p>
<p>In the same direction on Via Antonio Gramsci and just another few yards away, Lenin, Engels, and Marx look on imperiously as Gramsci sits atop, and cast again in black. The muralists label the bottom three figures but Gramsci is left unnamed. The clue is in the narrative detail “<em>A Livorno nel del 1921 lascia P.S.I. e fonda it Partito Comunist</em>.” In Livorno in 1921 he leaves the Italian Socialist Party and founds the Communist Party.</p>
<p><img src="media/image8.png" style="width:6in;height:2.09583in" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 10: Gramsci, Lenin, Engels, and Marx</strong></p>
<p>Again, moving in the same direction down Via Antonio Gramsci the 1920 strike of Fiat workers in Turin is memorialized in a mural that depicts the workers marching away from the factories holding the red flag aloft. The strike was executed due to the lack of recognition for the workers’ factory councils: A form of self governance and management by factory labor (see Bellamy &amp; Schecter). What we can see from the murals on this one street, then, is a clear reverence for Gramsci and historical left wing revolutionary movements. “Via Antonio Gramsci” is certainly not an empty signifier.</p>
<p>What then, can we learn from this dialogical analysis of Obama’s appearance on Via Antonio Gramsci? Clearly Obama does not have the same revolutionary Marxist credentials as Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Gramsci, but what is his relationship to Silvio Berlusconi? Berlusconi’s politics puts him as persona non grata on Via Antonio Gramsci. Silvio Berlusconi is notable for his portfolio of business interests that placed him as a controversial candidate for Prime Minister in four separate Italian governments. As owner of Fininvest, Berlusconi owned Mediaset, which held a virtual monopoly over commercial Italian television channels (Ginsberg). As one of the richest men in Europe in 2000, Berlusconi opposed the center left Olive Tree coalition branding any use of state power <em>Communist</em> (Ginsberg). Berlusconi was a by-word for corruption before any formal charges were brought against him, but in 2015 they were formally brought against him and he was sentenced to 3 years in prison for bribing a senator to defect to his party and effectively bring down the Romano Prodi government in 2006 (Bolton). From the word <em>PROCESS</em> and the expression of gritted teeth of Berlusconi in the mural we might assume that this image is indexing the legal proceedings that were brought against him. And yet, this sentence of three years would not be served as “the statute of limitations on his crime will kick in before the appeals process can be completed” (Bolton, para. 1). The results of the legal proceedings in 2015 would not have been known by the artist, and yet, there appears to be an inherent sarcasm at play in the image. The process, in other words, is not much of a process at all. Likewise, progress is also an illusion.</p>
<p>Rolston dwells on the Obama Berlusconi mural and suggests that it connects to a theme of rejection of metropolitan politics in general. For Rolston, ethnic pride is connected to a consistent critique of Italian national politics and corruption. In other words, process is the other side of progress on the same coin of corrupt politics. The bold rendering of national and international politics using Shepard Fairey’s aesthetic is contrasted with a “subtle, positive, and indeed tender representation of local people, skills and traditions” (p. 87). We can therefore expect a portrayal of a U.S. president in Orgosolo to be critical.</p>

<p>Anti-American sentiment is not rare in this muraled town. Corso Repubblica is a street in the center of the small town that features a number of visual anti-U.S. sentiments. Presumably dating back to the late 1960s and 1970s, a vampire bedecked in Uncle Sam regalia goose steps holding sacks of cash denoted by the dollar signs. He marches in front of flags representing Vietnam and generic socialist red flags seen also behind Che Guevara on Via Antonio Gramsci. A green suited Vietnamese soldier has his gun trained on the Dracula-esque character. Text on the mural reads “<em>VIA I FASCISTI AMERICAN DAL VIETNAM</em>” or remove the American fascists from Vietnam.</p>

<p>A large depiction of the World Trade Center in New York with its buildings on fire is emblazoned across the Kikinu postcard and photo shop also on Corso Repubblica. The writing on the mural remains unclear and not cooperative with the efforts of my translation software, but I assume that this is a work of commemoration much as significant events are commemorated all over the town. Clearly there are fewer qualms about depicting this particular event in the small town many leagues away from the U.S. coast.</p>
<p>On the front of da Candela café on Corso Repubblica the statue of liberty is featured in a mural declaring solidarity with refugees. Lady liberty and a cityscape that also features a Florentine Duomo is on the other side of a wall from a group of travelers on a makeshift raft. The text reads: “<em>SIAMO TUTTI CLANDESTINI</em>”: we are all illegal. In this configuration, the statue of liberty is walled off from the people in need and looms as a beacon but only for a monotone dark city.</p>
<p>In light of such surrounding murals, it is hard to shake the notion that the icons of the United States and mainland Italy are a form of shorthand for imperialism in Orgosolo’s ecology of signs. It is also hard not to agree with Rolston’s implicit claim that the Obama Berlusconi mural is a critique of politics and corruption as two sides of the same coin. Such a message has a resonance in a town whose people resisted the Romans, the Carthiginians, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) who wished to build an airbase in the nearby Supramonte but were ultimately unsuccessful in the face of local protest (Rolston).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: Recuperating Geosemiotic Meaning</strong></p>
<p>This geosemiotic analysis has committed what appears to be a cardinal sin identified by Scollon and Scollon. We have attempted our analysis without the ethnographic experience that is necessary to observe social interaction orders in the spaces we have identified. Additionally, the types of sensory space that Edward T. Hall (<em>The Silent Language</em>; <em>The Hidden Dimension</em>) conceives of are not a part of our analysis: haptic, olfactory, and aural spaces are left unaccounted for. We have privileged the visual and reproduced an ocular-centricity in semiotics. As a method guided by geosemiotics, virtual geosemiotics does not take in the full ambit of the sensorium.</p>
<p>And yet, we have reached some preliminary conclusions regarding the context dependent nature of meaning for the Obama Hope image in Larose and Orgosolo. Virtual methods may only offer a window on context dependent meaning, but when data is easier to come by than physical mobility and research time, this window has some utility. Our virtual method, for instance, allowed us to uncover localized context dependent meanings of the Obama Hope image that we would not have otherwise garnered from a decontextualized semiotic reading. The virtual tools of Google Street View and geotagged photography from local news media, the loosely moderated CNN iReport and Instagram provided a visual assembly that represents an emplaced ecology of signs. Google Street View in particular allowed us to see the distance between signs, the significance afforded by proximity, directionality, and in general the dialogic intersemiotic aggregative effect. Google Street View offers a simulation of movement around a place, that coupled with the imagination of the researcher can provide a sensation of entering and exiting a distinct locale.</p>
<p>Geosemiotics enables us to see not only how a sign is interpreted in a given place, but how characters in ongoing stories gain different reputations in different locales. For the oil and shrimp workers of Larose, a distance was felt between them and the President in the aftermath of the Deep Water Horizon catastrophe. The word “Hope” was replaced with the phrase <em>What Now</em>? in an open questioning of the iconicity of the Obama Hope image.</p>
<p>In Orgosolo, metropolitan politics are viewed with suspicion and a threat to local agrarian ways of life, therefore, news of Obama’s election is equated with the scandals of Silvio Berlusconi. The judicial <em>process</em> of Silvio Berlusconi’s legal battles and the <em>progress</em> of Obama’s success, were both treated with equal derision. In Orgosolo, local agrarian life is celebrated as a virtue in and of itself and the activities of would-be invaders are rarely praised, with the notable exception of the Italian Left wherein Antonio Gramsci receives commemoration. The opposition to the metropolitan center is coded left, in contrast to Larose where we see the iconography of the political right celebrated.</p>
<p>Both of our murals appear to be unorthodox remixes of the Obama Hope image, but in their emplaced contexts both murals are situated, they do not stand out as anomalous features in their landscapes. The murals’ situated qualities share a peripheral status within their own nation states, and both have a contentious past and present with the wider world. Orgosolo possesses a deep ambivalence regarding its membership of the Italian state, and Larose finds itself at the end of a road that ends in a Gulf of Mexico tarnished by multi-national oil exploration. In such discourses, Obama Hope is a warning of hopes to be dashed and power to be corrupted.</p>
<p>The claim that place matters in the meaning of signs is a realization that is not new in visual communication methodologies or rhetorical studies, but virtual geosemiotics provides a systematic attempt to access those context dependent meanings. We would encourage further studies of circulating images that take on different salience depending on their location in the world. Our choices of the Obama What Now [?] mural and the Obama Berlusconi mural were intentionally driven by a desire for variance in emplaced meaning and a desire to understand how Obama Hope was infused into murals as acts of resistance. Truth be told, we were still surprised by the weight of critical valence that was indexed in the image relative to the ecology of signs in both Orgosolo and Larose.</p>
<p>The value of our foray into geosemiotics is not contained solely within the case level findings we have garnered but in the potential future applications of virtual methods. The applications of virtual geosemiotics depend on the affordances of available technologies and as we proceed into the next decade we might assume that drone technology will be sufficiently advanced to provide real-time images even in hostile climates. Google Street View has its limitations as it provides a composite image and experience of a place in different times, even different years, but virtual geosemiotics may only realize the extent of its applications as geo-imaging technologies multiply and extend their capabilities. In the future, applications of virtual geosemiotics may extend to health communication, environmental communication, and most clearly, emergency and risk communication. For the moment, our critical-cultural project in visual communication has provided a germinal case study for using virtual geosemiotics.</p>
<p>The applications of virtual geosemiotics can be much wider than the use of Google Street View by researchers. For example, access to images obtained by drone or satellite may be used to analyze semiotic ecologies in places that are inaccessible for a variety of reasons. For instance, the hurricane season of 2017 rendered certain islands in the Caribbean Sea inaccessible and in some cases unreachable by traditional communication technologies. Other areas in recent times that have been difficult to access have included Fukushima in Japan following the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant accident; Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea suffered Ebola outbreaks in 2014; and myriad places that have suffered debilitating military hostilities such as Iraq and Syria in 2017. As the earth becomes hotter in the 21<sup>st</sup> century we might reasonably expect that more places will become more difficult to access due to extreme weather events and conflict over resources. Virtual geosemiotics might be put to a variety of applications in these instances. For example, does effective signage exist in emergency situations, are there <em>signs</em> <em>of life</em> after catastrophes, and can we improve our own signifying environments in case of catastrophic events? We leave others to explore these potential future applications as we focus for the moment on developing pathways for virtual geosemiotics.</p>
<p>In sum, we produced an account of how an object can change as it circulates into different localities with their own ecologies of signification. The static assumption that an artifact might contain an essence that is preserved in transit across physical space is challenged here by our exploration of geosemiotic methods. Our findings have suggested that with multiple sources of geographic indexing, virtual geosemiotics, as a method, can provide an account of how an object gains meaning from its geophysical placement, and how we, as mediators of visual communication, can use our critical judgment when engaging with the use of certain images in certain places.</p>

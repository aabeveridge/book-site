          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><strong>Final Note</strong></p>
          <p>In her 2011 <em>Technologies of Wonder: Rhetorical Practice in a Digital World</em>, Susan Delagrange reflects on the immense progress that has been made at the intersection of visual and digital production. Delagrange recounts a 2003 TechRhet listserv discussion about Cheryl Ball’s experimental job materials—when Ball was a PhD candidate at Michigan Technical University. In her application, Ball wanted to include an online portfolio of visual designs, but as the listserv discussion about her portfolio continued, Delagrange notes, “both the web usability and inclusion of images were debated” (vii). Eventually, the listserv contributors advised Ball to “omit the graphic and interactive elements of her job market website” and to “instead use only alphabetic, printable texts, thus mapping principles developed for spoken and written argument directly onto multimediated hypertext” (viii). Such anecdote demonstrates that visual research and production—especially in fields that were once dominated by text and alphabetic literacies—are often accompanied with significant risk and require researchers to undertake experimental methods. For Delagrange, the risk was becoming the first faculty member of a Big Ten university to successfully submit a born-digital visual project (<em>Technologies of Wonder</em>) for tenure. This risk is echoed in the very first question that opens Delagrange’s <em>Technologies</em>: “What is/should be the place of the visual in academic inquiry and representation?” (v).
          </p>
          <p>In many ways, this collection is evidence that Delagrange’s 2011 question is still relevant today. While the disciplines of RC/WS and Communication have come a long way in integrating the visual into our research and production practices, we argue that even more risking taking and experimentation is necessary in the digital age to keep advancing knowledge in these respective disciplines. We offer this collection, then, as an experimental exercise in digital visual studies. By experimental, we mean that each digital research approach offered here is in many ways a test of a methodological idea. This entire book, in fact, can be thought of as an experiment to test the value of visual digital studies for RC/WS and Communication at large. The continued progression for visual studies is dependent on the experimental orientation of visual research, and the willingness of scholars to take risks with their work. The questions raised by digital visual studies in this collection have clearly moved past whether or not the visual has a place in relationship to alphabetic literacies and traditional forms of scholarship. But here we continue to ask what role the visual can and should play in our academic inquiries and representations of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>In working at the nexus of visual rhetoric, digital rhetoric, and the digital humanities, we especially hope to keep pushing the boundaries of how RC/WS and Communication <em>do</em> visual studies. We believe that diversifying our methods and methodologies will only yield more knowledge about how digital visual artifacts and practices are impacting local and global communities and vice versa. Our theories about the visual, after all, are dependent on the research approaches we bring to our objects of study. As we diversify our research approaches, we diversify the knowledge we can bring to bear about any given study. Such diversification begins with experimentation, and we embrace the risks of experimentation here in order to harness any potential that digital design, research, and delivery may afford visual studies.
          </p>
          <p><span id="_qa0sy9nte7hb" class="anchor"></span>Due to such risk taking, we ask for you to approach this collaborative research project with an open attitude toward imperfection, if not failure, understanding the latter to be not an opposition to success but rather a mode of constitutive learning and a productive pathway to alternative research<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. In each of chapter, authors reach toward innovation and engaged in experimental projects that are intended to be built upon rather than taken up as finished and completed methodological projects. In their chapter with virtual geosemiotics, for instance, Archer and Collins argue that while virtual geosemiotics certainly cannot replace field work that allows one to do <em>in situ</em> research, this virtual method does offer a productive starting point for visual scholars interested in emplacement and the study of signs within local semiotic ecologies. In her chapter, on the other hand, Hallinan models what might be done with the Wayback Machine and digital media archaeology and ends by identifying how others might start their own research projects via this research approach. This collaborative digital research project as a whole, then, is intended to act, perhaps more than anything, as a springboard for methodological invention. We especially hope that readers will adapt the proposed methods for their own research, improving upon them as needed.</p>
          <p><span id="_74w8nbn9p4vd" class="anchor"></span>Because we are interested in the methodological potential of digital visual studies, we have asked a variety of scholars with expertise in related research interests to respond in video form to the work herein. We rely on these scholars to identify the potential of the enclosed digital projects, but we also invite these scholars to imagine otherwise, to imagine, in other words, how readers might build upon these proposed methodologies to advance RC/WS and Communication in ways we have yet to explore. These contributions, then, act as both a response and a catalyst for future endeavors in both DVS and other fields of study for which DVS may hold promise.</p>
          <p><span id="_gg0siecblnc5" class="anchor"></span>As the editors of this collection, we want to just close by advocating for more experimentation with digital visual studies. While the contributing work to this collection is full of potential, we recognize that we have just touched the iceberg of what can be done when we think creatively to harness the potential of digital technologies for visual studies. We also realize, of course, that new digital technologies are being invented every day. This collection ought to be considered, then, an invitation to take up future digital technologies for inventive play in visual studies. One day, perhaps, digital visual studies will become an obsolete title, as the digital will be so intertwined in visual studies that there is no need to highlight the digital’s inflection throughout the design, implementation, and presentation process. In the meantime, however, we encourage more digital play and more digital experimentation. As we embrace the digital more thoroughly and creatively in our research, we are excited to see where we, as visual studies scholars, can go from here.<span id="_lpi9se4gpaqn" class="anchor"><span id="_5gwa0inw1652" class="anchor"><span id="_1aojq0do193b" class="anchor"></span></span></span></p>

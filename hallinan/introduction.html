What you do not find is anything about the history of what used to be available at Obamicon.me, a once active website that Laurie Gries (2015) argues is largely responsible for the mass production <em>Obama Hope</em> remixes that began to widely circulate in 2009. The fact that Obamicon.me is no longer active is not surprising—with the average lifespan of a website estimated around 100 days, there is a lot of content going offline (Lepore 2015). Web users encounter this phenomena in the form of broken links (often marked with error messages or solicitations to purchase such as the offer above), being automatically redirected to a different website (which is what would have happened if you had attempted to access the Obamicon.me URL back in 2016), or finding old content overwritten by something new (what would happen if you purchased the domain and created your own website). In the face of such instability, often termed <em>reference rot</em> or <em>link rot</em>, one must look elsewhere to understand what Obamicon.me was and what happened to it.</p>
          <p><em>Paste Magazine</em> conceived of Obamicon.me in late 2008, a few months before the United States election of President Barack Obama (Paste Staff 2012), and launched the site January 7, 2009 with the message “Regardless of your candidate of choice in the 2008 election, here's your chance to sound-off&quot; (Paste Staff 2009). The site allowed visitors to create and share customized Obamicons, webicons designed in Stephen Fairey’s vectorized version of the Obama Hope image. To create an Obamicon, visitors could upload a photo or take one with a webcam, adjust the color levels, and insert a custom caption at the bottom of their own digital design (see Fig. 1). Once complete, visitors could save their Obamicon to their computer, share it through social networks such as Facebook or Twitter, and/or upload it to the gallery on the Obamicon.me site where other visitors could interact with it (see Fig. 2). As the announcement for the site urged: create, browse, rate or comment (Paste Staff 2009).</p>

          <p class="figurecaption text-center"><b>Figure 2.</b></p>
          <p>And people did. Within a week, the site had generated over 1.5 million views and 40,000 Obamicons, drawing in higher traffic than the monthly average for <em>Paste’s</em> primary website. <em>Paste</em> editor Josh Jackson explains that Obamicon.me “was officially bigger than our magazine site,” and it was later credited as part of the magazine’s successful business strategy of “generating buzz and traffic for a small, 180,000-cicrc<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> [sic] magazine in a tough independent music market” (FOLIO: Magazine Staff 2009). As part of this business strategy, the bottom of the Obamicon.me site featured a banner advertisement with an invitation to learn more about <em>Paste Magazine</em> and a trial subscription offer. <em>Paste</em> also partnered with online vendor Zazzle in order to offer visitors the ability to get custom Obamicons printed on items ranging from T-shirts to coffee mugs to more (Duffy 2009; Paste Staff 2012). To promote the Obamicon.me service, <em>Paste</em> launched a designated Facebook Page on 18 January 2009. Judging from the posts and the number of current Likes and Follows on the page, few initially listened (@ObamiconMe 2017). The company also launched a Twitter account to share news coverage of the service and relevant announcements, such as upgrades to the site’s server in response to heavy traffic leading up to the presidential inauguration (@ObamiconMe 2017). Such traffic resulted in the eventual creation of millions of Obamicons.</p>
          <p>With site traffic peaking around inauguration, it is clear that part of Obamicon.me’s appeal is tied up with politics and current events. Many political themes appear afterall, with variations of Obama’s image and the message of hope, such as the zombie Obama (L. Gries 2015), and the satirization of popular U.S. political figures, such as John McCain, Sarah Palin, and Bill Clinton. However, even that appeal is not so straightforward. Despite the name of Obamicons, <em>Paste</em> framed the site around self-expression and creativity rather than a political messaging—a frame that echoed in the coverage of the phenomenon. Online news sites and blogs often featured galleries of Obamicons selected for humor or quality rather than political commentary (for example, Marino 2009; <em>The Telegraph</em> 2009; Yoo 2009). These featured Obamicons tended to draw upon figures from popular culture, such as Yoda from Star Wars and David Bowie, or Internet staples, such as Rick Astley and cats.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> People also used the Obamicon-making tool to modify photos of themselves, their friends, family, and pets (Mackey 2009; L. E. Gries 2015). Whether used as a venue for creativity or a good way to waste some time, as a political tool or a small chuckle, Obamicon.me offered an ambivalent outlet. To the question put forward by someone on the Facebook page—“Can I like Obamicons and dislike Obama?”—the answer seems to have been decidedly yes.</p>
          <p>After the inauguration, the site continued to evolve both in form and offerings. Some of the changes involved making the image filters, in Obamicon.Me creator and <em>Paste</em> co-founder Tim Regan-Porter’s words, “white-labeled for clients” (Regan-Porter 2017). To white-label a product or service is to rebrand it so as to seem like a creation of a client company. Such white-labeling included the Green for All image filter, designed for the non-profit of the same name, and a sports filter for the Atlanta Hawks NBA team. Others incidents of white-labeling attempted to make Obamicon.me relevant to emerging events, such as the <em>Iranicon</em> (see Fig. 3) launched “to show support for democracy in Iran” and the <em>Luvicon</em> (see Fig. 4) designed to tap into Valentines Day celebrations (@obamiconme 2009). From the end of January 2009 through September of that same year, <em>Paste’s</em> Twitter account featured a webicon of the day to promote the site. Shortly thereafter, <em>Paste’s</em> Facebook Page and primary website stopped offering updates until the announcement of the site’s return in August 2012, just in time for the next election cycle (@ObamiconMe 2017; Paste Staff 2012). Despite the initial popularity of the site, as alternative automatic photo editing options, styles, and trends became available on mobile applications like Instagram, Snapchat, and Meitu and integrated into social networks such as Facebook, and the anchoring current events passed, interest in Obamicon.me waned. The declining interest lead <em>Paste</em> to take the site offline in 2013—the same year technology journalist Lauren Orsini declared “the year of the image,” citing the growing popularity of image-oriented social media sites such as Pinterest, Instagram and Tumblr (Orsini 2013). From 2013 through 2016, the URL continued to redirect visitors to <em>Paste Magazine’s</em> website and by 2017, the domain was listed as available for purchase. As one Facebook user commented, “Sadly its [sic] not working anymore .”</p>

          <p>I share this story because Obamicon.me raises interesting research dilemmas for digital visual studies scholars interested in studying visual history and preserving visual culture. If sites that are responsible for producing, storing, and circulating digitally born artifacts that make a lasting impact on culture(s) disappear, scholars lose important primary sources that provide important links to an image’s historicity. In the case of Obama Hope, although Obamicon.me has been taken down, traces of the site do remain scattered—from files saved on computer hard drives to photos uploaded to other social media sites, from custom printed Zazzle goods to blog and news coverage, from web forums to digital archives produced on Pinterest and websites. Despite these traces, according to Gries, the loss of access to Obamicon.me has resulted in the loss of what she approximates to be hundreds of Obamicons and related webicons that play an important role in Obama Hope’s rhetorical history (L. E. Gries 2015). For something with so much interest and uptake as Obama Hope, for something that has become so deeply embedded in the cultural psyche of our contemporary era, the immediate and complete takedown of the Obamicon.me domain marks a significant cultural void, especially for scholars of visual rhetoric. Since visual rhetoric aims to account “systematically for the ways in which images become inventional resources in the public sphere,” link rot poses a particularly pernicious problem (Finnegan 2004).</p>
          <p>Fortunately, digital research approaches and technologies do exist that can help address this dilemma, which is the focus of this chapter. Underlying this dilemma, it is important to understand, is a concern with the infrastructure that makes possible not only Obamicon.me, but also the entire visual web. To attend to infrastructure is to examine a set of prior conditions or structuring relationships that influence an image’s unfolding and materialization. Media archeology is a particularly useful research approach for foregrounding infrastructure, especially the conditions that make the reproduction and circulation of images possible. Drawing from a German Media Studies tradition, media archeology is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of media that brackets content as an epiphenomenon in order to look backwards at the enabling conditions.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Media archeology is especially useful for recovering sites such as Obamicon.me and the cultural practices that took place there in that it encourages us to look for places of decay, failure, or absence and offers strategies for analyzing the social and technical structures that facilitate historical phenomena. The now-defunct Obamaicon.me site is a case perfectly consistent with media archeology’s general preference for sites of failure, error, and stasis; the removal of the site is an instance of infrastructural inversion (Bowker and Star 1999), an accident or breakdown that suddenly makes infrastructure a visible and pressing concern.</p>
          <p>Due to its ability to draw out the infrastructure of the visual web and complicate our understanding of the materiality and temporality of visual culture generally, this chapter argues that media archeology can be a valuable methodology for digital visual studies. This chapter will begin by providing an overview of media archeology, identifying its benefits for digital visual studies, and zooming in on the method of infrastructural inversion. Next, the chapter takes up infrastructural inversion to analyze the now-defunct image generator and social network site Obamicon.me, a study made possible by accessing the site through the Wayback Machine, the public-facing portal of the Internet Archive, the largest archive of the Internet. In addition to offering useful research approaches to helping recover an important part of visual history, this research shows continued relevance of older institutions and forms of centralized power on the existence of digital images, the emergence of new institutions such as the Internet Archive, and the relevance of these new institutions for the study of digital visual culture. Finally, the chapter concludes by suggesting other ways of using media archeology to expand digital visual studies.</p>

However, media archeology need not share the ontological commitments of those approaches in full. As John Durham Peters explains, "Bruno Latour, to whom I owe a lot, has polemically called for a 'flat ontology,' but in the works of some of his acolytes that can sound like a refusal to make critical judgments about the great inequality of things. Anyone interested in infrastructure, lookouts, and turning points needs old-fashioned sociology about how recalcitrant, not just how cool, 'things' are. Ontology is not flat; it is wrinkly, cloudy, and bunched." (30)<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>

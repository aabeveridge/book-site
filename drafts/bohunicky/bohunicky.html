<p><strong>Figure 1.1 - Overview</strong></p>
<p>In charting out a compendium for doing digital visual studies, many contributors to this collection focus on “remix” as a key technique for creating and researching digital images. Remix, broadly, refers to “collage, a recombination of existing reference images or music or video clips from popular digital culture, elements of which are mashed up into something new” (Stepanek qtd in Gries). Put perhaps less elegantly: remix <em>is</em> digital culture. We laugh at it in Obama and Biden friendship memes, nod along to it in auto-tuned Obama interviews-turned-songs, and play it in fan-made games re-appropriating Obama and his administration’s policies. Digital culture lives and breathes remix, and Obama Hope has been one of the most popular sites for practicing remix in recent years. The methodological approaches offered in the preceding chapters highlight this fact by demonstrating how remix can provide inroads to study the identities and discursive practices of various communities that have interfaced with Shepard Fairey’s iconic Obama Hope image.</p>
<p>While Stepanek’s definition provides a general overview of remix, and remixes of Obama Hope model how remix often unfolds within digital culture, on a micro level remix takes on many different styles, techniques, and modalities. Surrealist word and image games like the Exquisite Corpse, for example, rely on a group of players who collectively assemble an image by drawing part of the picture, covering it, and passing it to the next player to continue the drawing. Tijuana Bibles, on the other hand, merge together genres and popular icons into illicit comics that depict famous comic and cartoon characters engaging in sexual acts with characters who represent social archetypes of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. The type of remix practiced in Tijuana Bibles has connections with Renaissance paintings, which took icons from the Bible and brought them into contact with the people, places, and events from the 14<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup> century in Europe. Permutations of remix, each with distinct techniques, can also be found work in molecular gastronomy, graffiti, music, and more. In short, while digital culture (and the arts in general) thrives on remix in general, in each adaptation of remix we can find it taking on alternative styles of practice.</p>
<p>One style of remix provided by digital technologies and media is “glitch.” Glitch typically refers to unexpected, and usually unwanted, changes in a technological system. In “Glitch/Glitsh: <em>(More Power) Lucky Break</em> and the Position of Modern Technology,” Benjamin Schultz-Figueroa explains that "in electronic systems the term [glitch] mostly references an unexpected event, a surging, a misdirecting, a severing of the flow of energy and information" (3). While glitches often completely crash software or hardware, on occasion the software will remain operable but in a transformed state. Some of these transformations can include mild visual effects including artifacts, distortion, and noise that interfere with a software’s visual aspects. They might also result in changes to operation, disabling functions that once worked and creating new functions that were previously impossible. Glitches can even completely re-organize interfaces and images, merging bits and pieces of an image or multiple images and re-combining them unexpectedly. In these ways, then, glitch also functions as a form of remix in that glitch takes “hold of the data and creatively remix[es] it into the reality of the moment” (Amerika). As Mark Amerika explains, the rhetorical power and sublime dimensions glitch-based remixes exude from how each foregrounds the myriad and nigh imperceptible ways that digital technologies and data are deeply interwoven into our day to day experiences. Glitch-based remixes unearth these blended techno-data-reality optics that challenge us to question how both our vision and view are always compromised and constructed.</p>
<p>Due to such affordances, glitch-based remixes can provide digital visual studies scholars with a productive means of revealing and engaging the underlying logic and ideologies of digital technology. Benjamin Mako Hill, specifically, suggests that we can use glitches to expose the inner logic of an operating system. According to Hill, glitches are a form of digital “utterance” that signifies how digital systems operate and are used: "An inverted u exposes a human typesetter, a letterpress, and a hasty error in judgment. Encoding errors and botched smart quotation marks—a ? in place of a "—are only possible with a computer" (30). Whereas Hill explains how glitches reveal the processes and operators at the core of communication software, Casey Boyle addresses the possibilities of using chance-based utterances rhetorically. Because glitches index various mediators that are typically obscured during normal operations, they help inform us of how these mediators act on our communication and decision making. Used rhetorically, then, glitches make systems work in ways that can benefit the digital rhetor (such as, for example, revealing classified information under the guise of glitch), leading Boyle to classify glitches as “something that manipulates and something that can be manipulated." In addition to mediation, glitches can also reveal and challenge practices, beliefs, and principles embedded within digital technologies. Rosa Menkman’s “The Collapse of PAL,” for example, prominently features glitch-effects that can only emerge from a PAL signal. Although these effects are the result of an accident, Menkman captures and displays them to reflect on PAL’s obsolescence and expose how (through a lineage of visual artifacts) newer signals like DVB “inherit…or appropriated from” older signals such as PAL (Menkman). In doing so, Menkman’s glitch showcase provides just one example of rhetorical engagement with planned obsolescence by performing media archeological “art-work.”</p>
<p>While such work exists on the rhetorical and artistic applications of glitch, less work has been done on its potential applications for research, especially digital visual studies. As the examples from Hill and Menkman both demonstrate, glitch is a form of remix that creates equal opportunities for engagement and education about how software and digital media operate. In this chapter, I reflect on the latter, and I present glitch as a form of research-creation for digital visual studies and highlight several of its potential applications. I do so by applying a homemade glitch technique called “image melding” to Fairey’s Obama Hope image. In the first section of the chapter, I begin by tracing the popularization of visual “glitch-effects.” My account in this section specifically engages with a potential conflict between the tool-based- and chance-based techniques for actualizing digital visual images’ potential becomings. In the section that follows, I position glitch-based remixes as a research creation practice for Obama Hope and digital visual culture broadly. Here, I describe how I developed and applied image melding to the Obama Hope image. Image melding works across modalities, combining by corroding and corrupting the boundaries between digital games, digital images, and digital film. The results are a sublime, chance-based aesthetic engagement that amplifies the potential rhetorics within the field of digital, data-fied images, allowing the expansion of our perception from reality as such, to reality as techno-data-reality construct. This widening gestures towards the presence of invisible discursive actors on and surrounding the image, as well as potential actors and communities that might possibility emerge from the multimodal meld of various discourses--digital scrying, in a sense. The chance-based optics provided by glitch-based remix cannot be re-created, so this section does not offer a step-by-step tutorial to re-create specific melds. For readers interested in playing with and creating their own melds, however, I provide a general description of the technique that will allow readers to experiment with image melds and potentially discover techniques of their own. By melding, we can glimpse at the invisible and potential (as well as potentially unrealized) futures of visual discourse and digital communities as they collide with and amplify the content of various digital images.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming Glitch</strong></p>
<p>While “The Collapse of PAL” demonstrates that visual glitches are capable of rhetorical engagement, it also highlights an important distinction between glitch and glitch-effects. A computer crash is not a glitch, but rather the effect of a glitch that indexes a deviation within the system; similarly, the scrambled content of a word doc is an effect that indexes a glitch within word processing software. What we see when we view Menkman’s work are not glitches themselves, but rather glitch-effects that serve as something of a “digital fingerprint” signifying some kind of error within a digital signal/system. Although the distinction might seem arbitrary, the popularization of glitch as a visual filter is established on the separation of glitch from its visual effects in much of the same way that decaf coffee and non-fat chocolate allows one pleasure sans risk (Zizek).</p>
<p>The use of glitch-effects as a visual aesthetic and mode of remix has many origins ranging from the art of Kintsugi to surrealist games of chance. Nick Briz, however, suggests that its emergence as a popular digital form arose during early 2009, around the same time that Barack Obama began his first term as President of the United States and the Obama Hope image was experiencing a rapid intensity of remix. Shortly after his election, Kanye West released the music video for "Welcome to Heartbreak." Despite political disparities between the two, Obama and West both rose to prominence during "The Great Recession." This economic crash, which originated from a failure within the US housing market and banks, influenced the rhetorical stylings of both Obama and West. Obama's inaugural address, responding to the corrosion of national trust in such systems, sought to restore confidence by invoking respected historic figures and using repetition as well as carefully measured pauses. Within Obama’s address, such techniques operated as signals cuing his audience to the return of control over an increasingly chaotic economy, environment, and geopolitical landscape. But whereas Obama expressed order, West glamorized collapse. West's visual aesthetics in “Welcome to Heartbreak” signify corruption and failure through glitch-based visual effects such as datamoshing that tapped into the lingering anxiety and dread of the individual amid national failure. According to Briz, West's video was a deeply formative moment for glitch art (personal correspondence). Whereas Obama's address galvanized Americans to face and resolve these failures, West's video demonstrated how the public could embrace and rhetorically harness such failures as a visual digital utterance.</p>
<p>Of course, West was not alone in exploring visual glitch-effects as a modality. Several artists emerging at the same moment also helped ensured that glitchy, broken digital aesthetics reached the larger public. For example, Chairlift's "Evident Utensil," another video featuring datamoshing, was released just a few months after "Welcome to Heartbreak." Although both West and Chairlift feature datamoshing, Chairlift's use of this visual technique suggests connection and fluidity, showing that crashes and glitches can unite as much as they can divide. Similarly, Sonny Moore, best known by his stage name Skrillex, began his solo career innovating and popularizing the glitchy, broken sounds and visualizations of dubstep over the same period. Examples of glitch aesthetics in popular culture including film, digital games, and other media unsurprisingly abound during this period of global unrest and collapse, positioning glitch as a visual vernacular for addressing and understanding the uneasy state of the U.S. and the world from 2009 onward.</p>
<p>Perhaps in response to these problems, 2009 remains a critical moment for glitch art as it marks the moment when visual artists, designers, and programmers began to explore glitch as a visual signifier. In doing so, many began to strip glitches’ visual indexes away from the crashes and failures that produced them. These changes led to the development of tools and scripts that allow users to instantly produce visual glitch-effects over a photo of the user’s choice without having to corrupt a computer—a trend which coincidentally occurred around the same time that visual tools like Obamicon.me began to circulate. In <em>Still Life with Rhetoric</em>, Gries explains that Obamicon.me and similar tools for visual remix allow users to rapidly produce social and political rhetoric through a specific visual discourse. The glitch tools and tutorials of 2009 served a similar purpose, allowing users to rapidly produce social and political visual engagements with technology’s embeddedness within daily life and being. As demonstrated by their widespread use in various social communities such as FaceBook’s “Glitch//Request” group or Reddit’s “glitch_art,” tools such as Snorpey’s “Image Glitch Tool” and scripts like the “GenerateMe” package have become and remain popular because they allow users to easily blend images and glitch-effects to rhetorically deploy visual signifiers for corruption, violence, spectrality (haunted-ness), isolation, disorder, mechanization, digitization, and decay. Common uploads include selfies, various political and popular figures, and places like graveyards, alleyways, etc. Glitch-effects are added to amplify as well as comment on some aspect of the image. A neon-lit alleyway, for example, might use a VHS vertical roll to express the multi-temporality of a place (that the 1980s still resides within the 21<sup>st</sup> century); similarly, a politician might be datamoshed with another image to imply their entanglement with various corrupt agendas and supporters.</p>
<p>Yet these visual remix tools also create problems. Specifically, while tools facilitate rapid creation and circulation, they do so because they rely strongly on the repetition of discrete visual signifiers. The repetition of the Obamicon, for example, ends up preserving and protecting a “visual DNA” that adheres to the specific visual style and structure the original Obama Hope image. Glitch-effect tools perform similar work, allowing users to change the image while largely reproducing the same visual DNA each time. In doing so, such tools convey a problematic discourse rooted in visual purity, visual gatekeeping, and exclusivity defining as much of what can be said with visual media as what cannot. In short, by granting control over the content and form of digital remixes, tools impose restrictions on an image’s becoming.</p>
<p>Becoming, in Gries’ work, refers to “a virtual-actual process in which any given thing, better thought of as a multiplicity, ‘changes in nature as it expands its connections’ through its <em>constant</em> production with time and space” (31). In other words, becoming refers to the potential transformations and mutations that any visual artifact or media might undergo as it spreads and circulates. To simplify this explanation a bit more, we can understand becoming as the children’s game “Telephone.” In “Telephone,” one player comes up with a phrase and whispers from one player, who whispers it to the next player, who whispers it to the next until the phrase is finally announced by the last player. Although the goal is to preserve the original phrase, the fun of the game comes from the errors that occur during each re-telling, leading to an entirely different phrase at the end. What starts as “I like apples” might end as “I hike Naples.” Becomings are just this: a process through which something, as it moves around and comes into contact with different agents, undergoes transformations that result in a very different something on the other side.</p>
<p>Although tools might inspire, as Gries argues, potential changes in images once they arrive at a link (or whisperer) in the chain, the telephone game shows that becomings can also occur through errors and noise that arise in the transmission of a phrase from one whisperer to the next. We should locate this becoming “in-between,” somewhere within the interaction between user and the tool rather than between user and user. As Steven R. Hammer argues in “Writing Dirt, Teaching N0ise,” tools tend to elide or purposefully guard against this type of becoming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>many still talk of noise as though it is a distinct and separate event-agent that spoils the communication part. We might call this the myth of noiselessness. It is pervasive, available in nearly every advertisement for contemporary digital devices. It is the promise of functionality, the increasingly clean and polished interfaces, the decreasing ability of users to understand or modify digital tools. (Hammer)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet noise is critical to the creative evolution and becoming of visual images, and while tools may try to ineffectively cap this form of creative evolution, embracing noise allows for unexpected becomings to emerge. As N. Katherine Hayles explains “noise in a communication channel need not always destructively interfere with the message, but rather could itself become part of the message” (3). The Telephone game demonstrates this fact, showing that “errors” are in fact discursive becomings of the originally transmitted media (be it words, writing, or image) and integral to its exchange—we play because of a fascination with unexpected changes in the information channel that lead to unforeseen transformations in the original media. And perhaps we might research (with and through) glitch to catch a glimpse at visual media and communities to come.</p>
<p><strong>Researching with Glitch</strong></p>
<p>Chance, epiphany, noise, and erring have all played a critical, albeit understated, role in research, and following their obscured trail offers some guidance on using glitch for digital visual studies research. Reed Ghazala, founder of the chance-based art of circuit bending, comments on the role of chance in research. He writes, "Chance is a powerful, creative force whose 'accidents' have not only provided us with art but also the discovery of penicillin, infrared and, well, velcro. Truth is, chance discovery is the root of much of our understanding of the natural laws that govern our very existence" (14). In “From Heuristic to Aleatory Procedures; or, Toward ‘Writing the Accident,’” Victor Vitanza supports Ghazala’s reading of chance-based research. Vitanza explains that “aleatory procedures” in writing and research, which means a “throw of the die” (186), might be viewed as a “condition of the possible still practiced under the sign of the negative” (188). Chance takes what is not (and, is some cases, cannot) be and miraculously brings them into being—it materializes the immaterial and makes possible the impossible. Chance re-casts the order of the world and bucks against its putative laws. It allows writers to access “whole new worlds of writing that heretofore have been forbidden or hidden from us” (191). Furthemore, chance can be a productive means of generating insight in many research contexts. As Paul Feyerabend writes "science is much more 'sloppy' and 'irrational' than its methodological image...For what appears as 'sloppiness', 'chaos' or 'opportunism' when compared with such laws has a most important function in the development of those very theories which we today regard as essential parts of our knowledge of nature. <em>These 'deviations', these 'errors', are preconditions of progress</em>" (160).</p>
<p>Despite such arguments about the power and influence of chance-based practices in research, many research practices and practitioners adhere to linear and fixed models. William M. Trochim et al.’s description of research practices in <em>Research Methods</em>, for example, explains that "In our everyday life we think about the world around us. We consider options and make choices. But much of this thinking is done dynamically, changing and adapting to the circumstances as they unfold. Research is different. It is a conscious effort to concentrate our thinking, to do it in a rational, careful manner. This is the key to the systematic nature of research" (5). For Trochim et al., research is not <em>dynamic</em>, but rather the act of molding one’s thinking and practice into a disciplined and intentional process that privileges rationality. They conclude with the term “systematic” (and associate it with the “nature” of research), suggesting that research (and, by proxy, research methods) embody a specific organization of interconnected parts working together in unity. Their ideas about organization and unity can be found in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's <em>A Treatise on Method</em>. Coleridge explains "The word METHOD...being of Grecian origin...literally means <em>a way, or path, of transit</em>. Hence the first idea of Method is a <em>progressive transition</em> from one step in any course to another; and where the word Method is applied within reference to many such transitions in continuity, it necessarily implies a principle of <em>UNITY WITH PROGRESSION</em> (2). Much of what Coleridge describes is implied in the more general descriptions of research throughout first-year writing textbooks and Rhetoric and Composition more broadly. For example, Wayne C. Booth et al.'s description in <em>The Craft of Research</em>, presents research as “sound ideas based on good information produced by trustworthy inquiry and then presented clearly and accurately” (9). And, more generally, the Oxford English Dictionary defines research as “The act of searching carefully for or pursuing a specified thing…Systematic investigation or inquiry aimed at contributing to knowledge of a theory, topic, etc.” In each definition, method is synonymous with unity, rationality, and discipline.</p>
<p>Given the conflict between traditional research practices and non-traditional chance-based research practices, how ought digital visual studies take advantage of glitch in its research practices? I suggest enacting glitch as a means of “research-creation.” Research-creation is an arts-based approach comprised of interdisiplincary theories and philosophies insisting that "art itself activates and constitutes new forms of knowledge <em>in its own right</em>” (Manning 52). As Owen Chapman and Kim Sawchuk argue in “Research-Creation: Intervention, Analysis and “Family Resemblances,” research-creation favors arts-based research practices because it allows researchers to engage with forms of knowledge that cannot be easily quantified or reflected by traditional research practices. Rather than advocate for systemized, methodical practice, research-creation values “processes that employ the irrational, the random, the unexpected” and acknowledge that “the accidental feed[s] into innovation and into the discovery of new forms” (Poissant). From a research-creation perspective, “the digital age—a common denominator between media and methods of expression—is also [and especially perceived to be] a generator of serendipity, as it increases the number of unforeseen connections and links between disparate elements and flows of signifiers” (Poissant). Rather than relying on typical quantitative and qualitative research apparatuses such as data-driven questionnaires, participant observation, or case studies, then, research-creation methods take place through artistic, experiential practice. As such, for many research-creation practitioners, research-creation practices results in new forms of knowledge that challenge and, in many ways, are unrecognizable through conventional research perspectives.</p>
<p>Research-creation essentially argues that meaning is in the making; glitch, however, demonstrates that meaning can also be in the <em>breaking</em>. When working with glitch in its myriad forms, we should generally pursue a practice that materializes the embeddedness of technology and data within our lives and being. With glitch, this is best accomplished through unconventional and novel operations of technology, often through “misuse” that risks the integrity of the system. This is not simply a facile return to the modernist adage “make it new.” Technology does work, and as Rob Kitchin and Martin Dodge argue in <em>Code/Space</em>, that work and its ethics are often deeply blended into and constitutive of our environments and socio-cultural practice. The optics of glitch are intimately connected with technology’s doing, and misuse allows us to illuminate and repurpose data and technology--potentially granting moments of insight into the politics of digitalization. Misuse, as an ethics, moves away from a deterministic relationship with technology in which our exchange is comfortable but compromised; instead, it privileges a relationship in which we and technology are co-constituted and collaborative agents--potentially revealing insights that would remain hidden if technology simply functioned as a tool. In the following section, I outline several strategies for digital disobedience and glitch-based research.</p>
<p><strong>Methoddity: Conditions for Play</strong></p>
<p>Glitch, as a research-creation practice for digital visual studies, will always unfold differently for each researcher. As previously discussed, chance rules the research process and thus research must become comfortable wandering through an image’s pathways, playing with various glitch techniques, constructing unapproved and dangerous ecologies of software, and closely following an image’s becoming as it corrupts. In this section, I model what such phases of glitch-based research-creation might entail, but I do not offer a prescriptive account of glitching as a research-creation practice. Instead, I guide readers through my own creative research practice, describing along the way the techniques I deployed and insights that emerged in relation to Obama Hope. I begin by describing several experiments with creating visual glitches through already established techniques for creating visual glitches such as databending and the “GenerateMe” package. Following this discussion, I then invite others to play and build on a self-created technique I call image melding. Glitches have often been thought of a terminus for both communication and signification; however, my research-creation with Obama Hope demonstrates that as various glitches are performed on an image, it begins to show “conductive” qualities that continue to facilitate the transmission of data and cultural information.</p>
<p>The first phase to glitching is to wander, guided by the discursive “pathways” suggested by an image. Wandering here refers to a practice of becoming familiar with the various techniques and visual discourses that are used by practitioners in the field by navigating their various communities and collectives. Through this initial work, it begins to become apparent which communities the image does (and does not) resonate with, what kinds of values and beliefs might be amplified within the image, and which techniques will be most useful in doing so. Communities like Glitch Tool Time and r/Glitch_Art serve as an excellent starting point for inspiration and conversation that will introduce different techniques for doing digital visual research-creation with glitch. Afterwards, paying attention to the image’s formal qualities (in this case, Obama Hope’s color, layout, perspective, etc.) and what it actually depicts will further help nuance the search for communities and techniques. As a political image, for example, Obama Hope lead me to specifically hunt for collectives and individuals interested in applying glitch-effects to political images (for example, Displaced/Replaced on Facebook) who showcase specific glitch-effects that, when paired with political content, work at more effectively amplifying certain aspects of an image’s communication. Similarly, the prominence of Obama’s face in the image can work well with a technique like pixel sorting, which makes it seem as if an individual’s identity has become digitally smeared or blurred. This phase of research-creation also allows one to sample signature glitch techniques and place others’ glitch processes and remixes into conversation with their own, which creates the potential for using glitches to create connections across various different communities of practice.</p>
<p>Through wandering, for instance, “databending” reveal itself as a potential candidate that could work well with Obama Hope. Databending involves opening an image file (.jpg in my case) in a text editor such as Notepad++. In doing so, the application merges text and image, producing what looks like a bunch of junk characters. Databending modifies characters in the text editor by deleting, adding, and cutting/pasting characters. Like searching through glitch communities for various techniques, this also allows a practitioner to discover techniques that might work well with their potential image. But unlike the intentional, and even perhaps, planned research phase above that guides initial search for glitch techniques within various glitch communities, databending encourages discovery through play and chance-based aspects of glitch.</p>
<p>While databending, the researcher will meander through an image’s data. The experience is, at first, overwhelming. Bit by bit, however, the researcher will begin to understand the illegible and inscrutable characters through practice. From this perspective, the characters translate into potential actions upon the image, and their “meaning” can be grasped from how they do and do not transform an image such as Obama Hope when plugged into sensitive areas in the image data.</p>
<p>For example, <em>ã\¯3n{!À5G%ýÉÌÙ{ckØöAc¸öBwT§ÅÚ}´%Ì—ˆ-×ˆ_Òóÿ</em> does work, and that work changes as it is anagrammatically re-arranged and connected to other data in the text editor display of Obama Hope.</p>
<p>From this view, Obama Hope (and digital images generally) appear akin to the necker cube: a multistable image that is both image and data. With databending, we can begin to appreciate the “shift from seeing technical objects as static entities to...temporary coalescences in fields of conflicting and cooperating forces” (Hayles 86). Obama Hope is not an image, but rather a crystallization of various actants. Some actants exert an outward force to maintain the semblance of an image and preventing it from becoming anything other than the image of Obama, whereas others allow for Obama Hope to connect with other glitch-based political discourses. Glitching the image becomes a way of “conversing” with and mobilizing the image’s digital actants. The computer and its software become co-creators revealing aspects unseen in the original Obama Hope image.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2.1 - Databend</strong></p>
<p>After exploring weird and evocative databends as well as the work of glitch communities, one can begin to explore the wide range of possible glitches by playing with various scripts. I recommend downloading tsulej's "GenerateMe" package, which is an archive of Processing scripts used to create glitchy effects that go well beyond what can be done just by databending. GenerateMe allows for the exploration of a wide range of possible video, image, and audio glitches—providing a flexible framework for experimentation and demonstrating that glitch can dissolve multimodal barriers. While using GenerateMe, for instance, I was able to engage in a more focused style of create play with pixelsorting. Pixelsorting creates an effect of motion and digitization. The fragmented, blocky streaks that emerge give a sort of "digital life" to Obama Hope, commenting on the technology, data, reality mix that Amerika gestures towards in his work. Although these scripts largely eliminate the chance-based properties of databending, the ability to deploy specific visual glitch-effects present a rhetorical opportunity to say something about the content of the image. At this stage, any glitch-effects that a researcher discovers in the first two steps can now be used with precision to see exactly how they might work to comment on and expose insights about the image.</p>
<p><img src="media/image3.jpeg" style="width:6.48958in;height:3.64583in" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2.2 – GenerateMe</strong></p>
<p>Above all, databending and GenerateMe demonstrate the power of file conversion--in other words, taking a file and either converting it into another file type or opening it with a different software. The images below show some of the most evocative glitch-effects achieved by converting files with various script in the GenerateMe package.</p>

<p><strong>Image Melding</strong></p>
<p>While techniques such as databending and pixel sorting prove useful for research-creation, digital visual studies scholars should heed the call to misuse technologies in ways that forge alternative relationships and new meaning making opportunities. Image melding is one example of how research-creation with and through glitch can lead to productive insights about digital visual images. With image melding, I was able to embrace the chance-based aspect of glitch art--something that I had felt lacking in my experiments with GenerateMe. Image melding merges and blends images with video clips of digital games (other recorded media can be used as well). Image melding shares similarities to datamoshing, which takes two or more video clips and connects them through compression artifacts. Datamoshing, however, serves as a transition primarily connecting two clips. Image melding, on the other hand, blends an image directly into a video clip in strange ways. Whereas datamoshing connects, image melding fuses, and this fusion can (potentially) fuel research into visual images in some bizarre ways.</p>
<p>I explain the theoretical and methodological implications of this technique in my description of the process below. Many of these glitches are performed with games and, specifically, <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em>, because of personal preference—I personally enjoy <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em> and digital games in general as an experimental visual space (as well as its visual palette) more than the visual space offered by films. Yet, I also selected games because they give the researcher an additional layer of control over the meld. In film we cannot control the speed of individual characters on the screen or take the film in a different direction (for example, having Neo choose the blue pill instead of the red pill), and this means that there is less of an opportunity to play with what we capture in our recording and meld. Digital games, however, allow us to generate situations that are rife with visual potential for glitch-effects either in how we position characters, make the screen scroll and move, bring certain visual perspectives of the game world into view, etc.—in short, with games we can be more <em>rhetorical</em> in our visual deployments. One of the primary reasons I choose <em>Devil Daggers</em>, <em>DOOM</em>, or <em>Sonic Mania</em>, for example, is because the speed at which these games display and move visual frames allows for more interesting melds. This is, of course, not to invoke a qualitative comparison between one medium or the other. Film has as much potential for image melding as digital games, and readers are invited to make melds with all forms of moving and time-based visual media.</p>
<p>The first image meld occurred while streaming/recording <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em> using OBS. I attempted to edit the recorded footage of my stream that OBS had captured and found it saved as a .flv, which I tried to edit with Adobe Premiere. Adobe Premiere didn’t play nice with .flv, so I instead tried opening it in VLC media player version 3.0.1. and attempted to convert the .flv to the Adobe-friendly .mp4. Yet the file it produced was still buggy. I tried the process again, but this time I checked the "view file output" in VLC player that provides a display of the footage as it is being converted. Suddenly, my screen was filled with glitched footage. The video played five seconds, paused, and then replayed another five seconds until it reached the end of the video. During these five second windows, the video would lag and layer frames of the video onto each other.</p>
<p><img src="media/image7.jpeg" style="width:6.48958in;height:3.61458in" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3.1 – OBS .flv to VLC Player Error</strong></p>
<p>I went back to OBS, switched the capture format to .mp4 and recorded VLC player chugging busted footage. Although this was a big step, all I had was some fascinating glitched video of gameplay. OBS, however, would allow me to record anything that was happening on my computer screen--even activities I might be doing while VLC player was playing back the glitched footage. Thus, I went back and recorded gameplay as .mp4, opened the .mp4 file and set it to play on my monitor, then I used OBS to record the recording--this time, however, I recorded it as .flv. While OBS records the recording, I took the Obama Hope image and frantically drug it around the monitor being recorded. By doing this, OBS records both the glitched game footage and the moving Obama Hope image. Opening this .flv file and converting it in VLC player shows the same visual effects, but this time those effects apply to Obama Hope and meld Obama Hope into the game footage.</p>

<p><strong>Analyzing Image Melds</strong></p>
<p>In these videos, we encounter a sublime, chance-based aesthetic engagement that amplifies the potential rhetorics within Obama Hope through the variety of melds with the visual information of the games sampled. Certain melds are relatively minor with few distorted areas, meaning that the interaction between image and video is low; other melds, however, are almost entirely entangled, and the meld in these moments is much more significant. In this screen grab from <em>Sonic Mania</em>, for example, Obama Hope becomes deeply integrated into the game’s landscape while still retaining key iconic visual aspects of the original Hope image.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.3 – <em>Sonic Mania</em> x Obama Hope Landscape Fuse</strong></p>
<p>I describe these moments where the visual information between the video and image interchange and mix as <em>meld moments.</em> Meld moments can happen in many ways including ghosting (figure 4.5 – Hope Ghosting), multilayering (figure 4.6 – Hope Multilayer), expansion, (figure 4.7 – Hope Expansion), smearing (figure 4.8 – Hope Smearing), fusion (see figure 4.4 Hope Landscape Fuse), etc. These moments can, of course, be deployed rhetorically to create visual arguments about the image, the video content, or both. In this article, however, I am solely focusing on image melding’s applications to research.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.7 – Hope Smearing</strong></p>
<p>Meld moments are evocative because they suggest a connection (in several different ways) between the visual information of the game space and the visual information of the image (in this case, Obama Hope). And these visual exchanges are ideologically charged. In addition to gameplay, digital games’ visual and spatial design communicates themes, beliefs, and ideas. Yuji Naka, lead programmer of the original <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> series, for instance explains that he used the game to convey environmentalist themes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1991, it was a very sensitive subject to talk about the environment and while I had my viewpoint, I did not speak of it. With Sonic, I was given an opportunity to express my views in a different way and did so, showing Robotnik using pollution and creating machinery which desecrates the environment and it is down to Sonic to change his ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visually, many of the more environmentally friendly spaces are colored and structured to convey a “healthy” ecology that clashes against the more techno-centric design of areas that Dr. Robotnik negatively influences. As players, we encounter this information not just through what we do (beat Robotnik, free the animals, etc.), but also through the color, spatial layout, perspectives, movement speed, navigational possibilities etc. of each area. Thus, moments of melding may be used to identify moments of ideological connection between the image being melded (in this case, Obama Hope) and the ideological values expressed in the visual, spatial, and navigational design of a game. Perhaps, as we see in the <em>Sonic Mania</em> meld, Obama Hope implies a degree of environmentalist visual rhetoric that becomes all the more apparent as we begin to meld it with a game explicitly expressing these themes through its visual design.</p>
<p><img src="media/image14.jpeg" style="width:6.47917in;height:3.65625in" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3.8 – Sonic Mania x Hope Meld</strong></p>
<p>Image melding, as a technique, also allows us to look for visual appeals that an image might not be making or might make differently. The blue environmentalism of <em>Ecco the Dolphin,</em> for example, is different in many ways from the environmentalism of <em>Sonic Mania</em>. While Obama Hope undergoes a meld with <em>Ecco the Dolphin,</em> the meld happens more through multilayering and fragmentation rather than the full-on fusions seen in the <em>Sonic Mania</em> clips. This change in connection suggests a rougher connection between the visuals, perhaps hinting at some of the conflict between the visual ideology of Obama Hope and <em>Ecco the Dolphin. DOOM</em>, similarly, takes on Obama Hope much differently, featuring the greatest amount of smearing and “ghosting” in which the structure of the image is retained but everything else is stripped out and replaced by visual content from the game (figure 4.8 – Ghosting Hope). Obama Hope’s colors invoke the community to which and from which “hope” is extended: the American public. Without these colors, all that remains is the word “hope” and the portrait of an individual (Obama, in this case). While the Hope landscape fuse in <em>Sonic Mania</em> creates a tight connection between the image, colors, and game environment, ghosting suggests a more spectral relationship in which connections are diffuse and unclear. When ghosting, Hope operates as an abstract presence in the larger conduit of visual information--something akin to a visual super-ego or id either jamming or driving the desires manifested through the game. In <em>DOOM</em>’s ultra-violent gore-fest, for example, one material aspect of the Obama Hope image that we can see through ghosting is the image’s more general function as injunction directed towards the individual and their actions. Beyond its red, white, and blue ethics for the American public, Hope melded with <em>DOOM</em> shows that the image can also provide a disconnected (and potentially disconcerting) justification for or against various actions. For digital visual research, melding thus presents us with a way of thinking askew, often in directions that formal analyses might be unable or even hesitant to address.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: Broken Hopes</strong></p>
<p>Throughout this piece, I present glitch as a means of “research-creation" for digital visual studies and have tried to show how glitch might work as a mode of remix for creating insight into the present and future of digital images. While I describe several different phases for practicing research-creation with glitch, I emphasize the importance of incorporating creative play and chance into the process. With image melding, I suggest that we might begin to understand shared visual registers between multiple kinds of media (image, game, film, etc.) and their potential meanings. Additionally, image melding might also expose what images can possibly become (or, perhaps, what they might never become). Where we discover sites for rhetorical and expressive melds, we might also glimpse forecasts of future remixes that only exist as pure potential. The ease and efficacy with which Obama Hope, for example, blends into the environmentalist palette of <em>Sonic Mania</em> may suggest that future rhetors will have an easier time using Obama Hope to speak to these kinds of environmentalist issues as opposed to say the metaphors that <em>DOOM</em> uses to criticize corporate corruption. Perhaps it also envisions a future in which the visual rhetoric surrounding the Obama campaign was used to more aggressively push environmental issues. In this sense, then, image melding is a manifestation of hope--both hope that has come to be, and hope that never will be. Through each image corruption, we can glimpse at a discursive horizon beginning to visualize what might be.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorial</strong></p>
<p>Image meld can be practiced with any two files and OBS plus VLC Player. The steps are a bit complex, so I’ve broken them down into sequences:</p>
<p>Sequence 1: Record your first layer</p>
<p>On a Windows pc (Mac not tested), open OBS 21.1.2, go to “Settings” in the file menu, click “Output,” and under “Recording Format” choose “flv.” Click “Apply,” then click “OK.” Next, open a file (I recommend a game, but it can be a film, set of images, word document, etc. but make sure there is motion involved) for OBS to record. If using multiple monitors, set the file to full screen on another monitor; on a single monitor, make sure the file is full screen before recording. Finally, choose “Display Capture” in the “Sources” box on OBS. Minimize or move OBS from the display and click “Start Recording.” Play the film or game, or scroll through the word document or image set as OBS captures for as long as you like (longer time means more glitches). Once you’re finished click “Stop Recording.”</p>
<p>Sequence 2: Capture glitches in your first layer</p>
<p>Now that you’ve created a flv recording (you can find it by clicking the File menu in OBS and then clicking “Show Recordings”), you’ll need to capture the glitches. To do this, open VLC Player 3.0.1. and select “convert / save” from the File menu. In the window that opens, choose your flv OBS recording, click “Covert / Save.” In the next window that opens, click the box next to “Display the Output.” Before clicking start, open up OBS again and set it to start recording the window that has VLC player open. Be sure that OBS is set to record in mp4, not flv. Click record, then return to VLC player and, after choosing your “destination file,” click “start.” If you’re on a single monitor, OBS should be minimized and recording the full screen VLC player; If you’re using multiple monitors, make sure OBS is capturing the monitor with VLC player full screen. This will simultaneously play and capture your glitched video. Be sure to save the mp4 file that OBS provides and delete the converted video provided by VLC player.</p>
<p>Sequence 3: Add another layer</p>
<p>Next, we perform the same steps but introduce another file into the recording. Locate the mp4 file that you’ve saved from OBS and open this file in VLC player. Set OBS to again capture VLC player, but be sure to set it back to flv. Before we click Record on OBS or Play on VLC player, open the image you want to meld in a borderless image viewer like Honeyview. Once you click record and play, you’ll drag this image over the video playing on VLC player. Since OBS is capturing a display and not a specific window, it will record both the movement of the image as well as the document/game/film/images/etc. playing in the background. Click “Start Recording” on OBS, then click the play arrow in VLC player and being dragging the image all over the display window that VLC is playing the recording on. Don’t worry if you accidentally minimize the window or close windows as these can be re-opened and will create additional interesting effects in your final recording! Once you are finished, click “Stop Recording.”</p>
<p>Sequence 4: Check your image meld</p>
<p>Now that you’ve got an flv file of your video and your image, follow Sequence 2 again. Open VLC player and select “convert / save” from the File menu. In the window that opens, choose your newly created flv OBS recording, click “Covert / Save.” In the next window that opens, click the box next to “Display the Output.” Before clicking start, open up OBS again and set it to start recording the window that has VLC player open. Be sure that OBS is set to record in mp4, not flv. Click record, then return to VLC player and, after choosing your “destination file,” click “start.” If you’re on a single monitor, OBS should be minimized and recording the full screen VLC player; If you’re using multiple monitors, make sure OBS is capturing the monitor with VLC player full screen. This will simultaneously play and capture your glitched video. Be sure to save the mp4 file that OBS provides and delete the converted video provided by VLC player.</p>
<p>Now you should have a strange mp4 image meld. You can continue to add layers and more images by continually following this process: capture mp4 as flv, play flv while dragging image around, capture flv as mp4, repeat. Experiment with different kinds of images, or drag a video over another video.</p>

          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><strong>Digital Visual Studies </strong></p>
          <p>In giving name to digital visual studies, we do not aim to introduce a new area of research per se. But we do hope to underscore the potentiality of digital visual research that is emerging across the humanities and to which we hope to contribute. We are excited, for instance, about Edgar Gómez Cruz, Shanti Sumartojo, and Sarah Pink’s recently published collection <em>Reconfiguring Techniques in Digital Visual Research</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. In this collection, scholars from across the humanities explore how digital visual technologies, such as drone cameras, Go-Pro cameras, eye-tracking technologies, and 360 degrees cameras, are helping to invent new research techniques for ethnographic research—research that we believe scholars interested in rhetorical field methods will particularly find useful. We aim to extend such digital visual research by exploring how digital research operating at the nexus of visual rhetoric, digital rhetoric, and the digital humanities can be as equally productive, particularly for research in RC/WS and Communication.</p>
          <p>We envision ourselves working at the nexus of visual rhetoric, digital rhetoric, and the digital humanities because, most simply, we share similar interests with and our research is most directly informed by each of these fields of study<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. With visual rhetoric, for instance, we share an interest in the relations between visual phenomena and public life—most particularly how the design, production, distribution, and circulation of visual artifacts enable collective identification, participatory action, and civic engagement. We are inspired, for instance, by the recent work of E. Cram, Melanie Loehwing, and John Louis Lucaites which explores how digital photography is transforming civic engagement. Digital photographs, they insist, are unique in that, most obviously, they not only are produced by digital cameras, smart phones or other digital devices but also “circulate through dynamic ecologies between physical places, device storage and clouds, social networking sites, and other forms of digital archiving.” Less obviously, perhaps, digital photographs remediate the conventions of analog photographs, make strategic use of indexicality, circulation, and repetition, and move beyond representation to draw audience attention to both the content of a digital photograph and the form, style, genre, and medium of presentation. In an era of digital culture, they build on Richard Lanham to insist, we no longer, if we ever did, look at and through photographs but rather <em>with</em> them--a multiplying perspective that enables “a new kind of civic practice that upends the traditional separation between those who act and those who see, making it possible for acts of seeing to fulfill the political functions of both rhetor and audience.” Digital visual studies recognizes such transformation in civic practice and participatory culture and aims to delve more deeply into how emergent digital technologies and new media practices are fueling this transformation in significant ways.</p>
          <p>We are especially invested in exploring how social media, software programs, mobile devices, digital applications, and digital machines are shifting the ways we interact with visual media and what the implications of such shifts are for individual and collective life. We thus also share a strong focus with digital rhetoric, which as a field of study is concerned with the analysis, production, and circulation of a wide range of digital artifacts, genres, and practices, including new media images. In <em>enculturation’s</em> recent special issue devoted to digital rhetorics, for instance, Jeff Rice explores how the digital aggregation of images, headlines, tweets, etc. leads to phenomena such as “digital rage” that takes place in social media environments. “Digital aggregation,” he explains, “foregrounds already held beliefs by computating them within a current, circulated image” such as the photograph of Cecil--the Zimbabwe lion killed in 2015 by a Minnesota dentist on an African safari hunt. “To compute the digital image of outrage,” in other words, one has to have “other accumulated aggregations stored in memory, emotion, action, personal history, or otherwise.” Such aggregations may develop via personal experiences, but in many cases, they are generated via news and popular culture, in this case for example, movies such as <em>The Lion King</em> or <em>Born Free</em> that create certain narratives about lions that we internalize. Such aggregations have always existed,” Rice notes, “but digital circulation and social media interactions make them extremely powerful today as technical images.” As scholars interested in digital visual studies, we work toward similar aims, identifying how digitally produced images in conjunction with social media and other digital technologies spread affect, trigger collective identification, alter ways of seeing and understanding, and in some cases, as Rice notes, exacerbate already-existing human emotions, logics, and behaviors as well as cultural phenomena.</p>
          <p>Just as the US presidential transition from Barack Obama to Donald Trump has influenced the trajectory of Obama Hope—a trajectory that Gries and Bratta explore in their chapter for this collection—so too has this transition revealed new and troubling challenges regarding the changing nature of digital rhetoric. As Aaron Beveridge explains in “Writing through Big Data: New Challenges and Possibilities for Data-Driven Arguments,” social networks have been transitioning away from user-generated peer-to-peer experiences that are truly <em>social</em> in nature and have returned to a centralized “broadcast” model where the circulation of digital artifacts is tightly controlled by filtering programs and algorithms (see also Smith and Brown). As such, Beveridge asks and responds: “<em>Who (or what) controls the broadcast? Who controls what users see in the network?</em> As advertising and shareholder value take precedence over peer-to-peer sharing, the ‘Power to Organize’ in many digital networks has been greatly reduced.” While these changes present many new challenges for digital rhetoricians, they are exacerbated by the ways in which filtering programs and social network algorithms can be manipulated by bots, click farms, trolls, and misinformation campaigns. In recent interviews, Jack Dorsey—founder and CEO of Twitter—admitted that content moderation <a href="https://youtu.be/-w6oU33n_zU"><span class="underline">“does not scale”</span></a> for global networks (Dorsey), and that it may be time to fundamentally rethink the design of social networks (HA). We believe that digital rhetoric—and digital visual studies in particular—is well positioned to utilize our unique constellation of methodologies in helping to redesign and rethink the ways that digital artifacts are distributed and visualized (trends, feeds, content moderation/aggregation) for users of social networks (see Beveridge and Van Horn chapter in this collection).</p>
          <p>In addition, alongside digital rhetoric, we value digital experimentation as a mode of knowledge production. We take inspiration from projects such as Sean Morey’s “Deepwater Horizon Roadkill Tollbooth (A MEmorial)” which offers a methodology and virtual model for creating a digital, conceptual, and affective mapping of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that occurred in 2010. We especially appreciate how Morey acknowledges the conceptual gains from engaging with such experimentation. As he notes, his actualization of the MEmorial, now just “a plan for a virtual, potential Memorial,…is not necessary for the project to succeed.” Morey offers a specific justification for such claim. In order to establish deep ecological relationships, he argues that we have to find ways to write about ecological disasters in ways that affect us and others and help tune us into our complex relations. Producing electrate ecompositions such as the Deepwater Horizon Roadkill Tollboth, Morey insists, can help foster such modes of composition and affective experiences. While we agree with such specific benefit, we also think that, in general, speculative projects such as Morey’s are productive for opening up novel, unexpected paths of scholarly research. Digital visual studies is similarly committed to the potentiality of digital research, the not-yet-realized possibilities that can only come through risk taking and experimentation with digital research and production.</p>
          <p>In this sense, we also share a commitment to methodological innovation, a commitment that is indicative of both digital rhetorics and the digital humanities. As Jim Ridolfo and William Hart-Davidson argue in the introduction to <em>Rhetoric and the Digital Humanities</em>, digital rhetoric and the digital humanities have developed with parallel and complementary trajectories. One of the parallel trajectories has been the transition from ideologically guided praxis to methodologically focused making and research. In the 2012 edition of <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em>, Tom Scheinfeldt’s chapter asks if this trajectory signals the “Sunset for Ideology, Sunrise for Methodology?” As a digital humanities scholar, Scheinfeldt explains that he “traffic[s] far less in new theories than in new methods” (125). Scheinfeldt describes this as shifting from “think[ing] about our world in terms of ideologies and our work in terms of theories” (124) to thinking about our work in terms of “organizing activities, in terms of both organizing knowledge and organizing ourselves and our work” (125). Digital visual studies shares similar concerns in that we wonder, most importantly, how our visual research can be enriched by diversifying our methodological perspectives and privileging the digital throughout the entire knowledge production process—from object of focus to research practice to presentation. This is not to say, of course, that digital visual studies is theoretically or politically void; many chapters in this collection forward productive theories that emerge from digital research (isotropic rhetorics, rhetorical undercuts, etc.) and many chapters take up important political concerns such as race, representational belonging for the LGBT community, and disability. However, like the digital humanities, digital visual studies simply puts the invention of digital research approaches at the center of methodological concerns in order to expand the scope and potential of visual studies.</p>
          <p>We are especially excited about doing digital visual studies because we think that scholars in RC/WS and Communication who are interested in the visual <em>and</em> the digital can make stronger efforts to consult and build upon each other’s research. Largely invested in their own disciplinary conversations, visual communication, visual rhetoric, and digital rhetoric scholars often miss out on the opportunity to forge connections between their already existing research projects and to collaborate on new, innovative ones. This lack of connection has implications for not just how visual research gets done across these disciplines, but, as Finnegan notes, who reviews manuscripts for presses and how much presses in rhetoric know about work coming out of communication vs. RC/WS (personal email). As an interdisciplinary enterprise, digital visual studies can help build a community of scholars invested in experimenting with digital objects and digital research to enrich visual studies across our disciplinary domains. In bringing together scholars from both RC/WS and Communication for this collection, we hope to model what productive avenues such collaborative efforts might open up.</p>

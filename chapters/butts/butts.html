<p><strong>“Making Hope: Critical Making as a Multisensory Approach for 3D Printing Change”</strong></p>
<p>Obama Hope is one of the most recognizable images produced in the 21st century. Featured on t-shirts, carved into pumpkins, printed on protest signs, and shared across a variety of digital platforms, Shepard Fairey’s graphic style poster was originally meant to raise support for a presidential candidate. However, Obama Hope’s bold colors, clean design, and viral circulation quickly made the image an icon and created a format easily remixed for protest, praise, or personal use. The digital technologies that helped the image “go viral” also provided unprecedented access, enabling people to remake the image to promote different ideas and rhetorical goals. Critics of Obama, for instance, replaced the “Hope” with “Dope” and shared satirical versions on platforms such as Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, and Reddit. More recently, Donald Trump’s election instigated several variations with his picture and the words “Grope” or “Nope,” and around the world, advocacy groups, political parties, and individuals continue to create countless versions of Obama Hope, each featuring new text or images to fit a different vision.</p>
<p>Such intense making and remaking of the Obama image illustrates that the power of Obama Hope stems not from an authoritative original, but the flexibility of the image - the "ability to transform in purpose, function, and form with each relation it enters into" (Gries 292). It also illustrates the participatory and embodied aspects of digital media. Digital images are more than just pixels on a screen. Every day, users interact with computers and mobile devices in visual, verbal, aural, haptic, tactile, and assorted other sensory ways. We swipe right to go on a date, use voice commands to Google questions, and track physical activity through wearables that rely on motion or gyroscopic input. As images and interfaces have grown increasingly more digital, scholars, artists, and designers have begun to engage bodies, materials, and technologies to theorize how we interact with visual data, reframing optic versions with embodied or sensory experiences. In <em>New Philosophy for New Media</em>, Mark Hansen draws attention to such experiences, arguing that bodies interact with digital images from “the entire process by which information is made perceivable through embodied experience” (10). What’s more, Hansen argues that these sensory experiences mean that a digitized image is not a fixed representation of reality but is defined by its complete <em>flexibility</em> and <em>accessibility</em>. The flexibility of new media enables viewers to become users that can access, remake, and circulate digital images, generating diverse embodied experiences across media platforms.</p>
<p>How we encounter digital images affects how we experience them. Seeing Obama Hope as a hanging collage in the National Portrait Gallery, or as part of a protest, differs from how we experience a digital version composed via Obamicon.me or a meme generator. Thus far in participatory culture, 2D digital images have dominated reproductions of Obama Hope. While productive for diversifying rhetorical messages across multiple contexts, technological practices that prioritize two dimensional versions of images also normalize how we experience images by privileging primarily optical interactions, which, in turn, limit how we come to know and see the world. What other technological practices might offer more accessible means of image making – a re-visioning that engages more diverse ways of understanding, seeing, and studying digital images? And how might digital visual studies cultivate other image-making methods that generate alternative ways to experience, sense, invent, access, etc. digital visual information?</p>
<p>In this chapter, I argue that 3D printing is a sense-making method that embraces difference as a site for rhetorical invention and encourages diverse ways of seeing and experiencing digital visual images. 3D technologies always start with an image. However, in modeling and printing visual data, the 3D process incorporates more than 2D optical information. The additive process of 3D printing builds up layers of material (heated plastic, powdered metal, wood chips, mud, etc.) to transform digital images into three-dimensional objects. This process, I argue, offers more diverse embodied ways of experiencing images and making sense of visual data. Thus, for this chapter, I experiment with critical making approaches and 3D printing technologies to create a 3D version of Obama Hope, an experiment that not only helps re-envision Obama Hope but also opens up more accessible approaches for doing digital visual studies.</p>

<p>In creating 3D prints of Obama Hope, I create a different experience of the image -- a way of seeing that is as much tactile as traditionally visual. This critical making experiment follows initiatives in many public institutions to try and make information more accessible using 3D technologies. Museums and galleries are full of three - dimensional objects, but most are seen only optically, the space traditionally a “DO NOT TOUCH” zone. However, many museums have expanded from an emphasis on preservation and collecting to education and experience – moving from the static and visual to the experiential and embodied (Pallasmaa). As a result, institutions are offering new types of access to artifacts and, at the same time, using emerging technologies to create more accessible experiences for a wider spectrum of visitors. Special tours offer interactive play projects for children, audio guides and downloadable applications provide multiple languages and additional information, and tactile interfaces and touch galleries offer different ways of seeing, sensing, and understanding information. 3D printing has especially become a popular means of diversifying experiences for the public. The Louvre, London’s National Gallery, Tate Museum, and New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art all have touch-friendly 3D printing programs that enable visitors to experience sculptural works without relying on optical perception. Originally created for blind visitors, Madrid’s Museo Del Prado is even using 3D technologies to translate paintings into hands-on experiences (Halliday 2015).</p>

<p>For example, through a 3D “relief printing” technique called “Didú, the “Hoy toca el Prado” (Come Touch the Prado) exhibit in 2015 used a 3D scanner to map the brushstrokes of a painting and build a topography of the surface. Then, a 3D printer added texture and volume by slightly raising the surface to exaggerate height and depth, creating a tactile image that museumgoers could feel (Hewitt). Similarly, Brazilian photographer Gabriel Bonfim is using stereolithographic 3D printing to create three-dimensional photos that can be both seen and felt, a technique he calls “tactography” (Watkin). In 2014, Bonfim photographed classical singer Andrea Bocelli and his family. However, Bocelli is blind and was unable to see the photos. Bonfim explains that tactography came from trying to create a photo relief that Bocelli could “see,” a process of tinkering and critically making until he developed a way to address the lived experience of Bocelli. Experimenting with technologies and techniques, 3D prints offer a new level of accessibility and education regarding visuals, fostering a truly hands-on experience of art and images.</p>

<p>Often, 3D inventions attempt to gain entry to an original form, what Walter Benjamin would term “the aura” of a text. In June 2014, for instance, Barack Obama became the first president to be 3D scanned and printed. Unlike traditional portraits, the 3D print of Obama is not a flat photo or artistic interpretation of a figure. Instead, the data driven process of 3D printing entailed taking “millions upon millions of measurements that create a 3D likeness of the President” (Metallo 2014). Obama’s three-dimensional ‘portrait’ resembles a presidential bust; standing 19 inches tall, weighing almost 13 pounds, it was created using visual data taken from over 80 photographs, light, and video scans tracing the exact cartography of the president’s head (Waibel). In mapping the planes of the president’s face, the 3D process provides access to visual information that might not be apparent on a screen - the contour of a brow ridge or the depth of wrinkles barely seen in a photograph. After converting the visual data into a digital model, the Smithsonian Digitization team printed the president’s head in just under 42 hours and displayed the unique portrait at the White House Maker Faire. The 3D print is now part of the presidential collection at the National Portrait Gallery, joining paintings, photographs, sculptures, life masks, and other work, including Shepard Fairey’s iconic poster, <em>Obama Hope</em>.</p>
<p>However, instead of trying to access an aura, 3D prints should be understood as more than an adaptation or copy of an original. 3D prints are different versions of an image altogether - different in form and function and separate versions in their own right. In <em>A Version of Access</em>, Casey Boyle and Nathaniel Rivers emphasize difference as a way to better engage accessibility and acknowledge the multiplicity of sensory experiences. Instead of approaching accessibility as gaining entrance to a static text, Boyle and Rivers explore what they call “multiple ontologies” – the many ways of processing and understanding texts (32). For example, rather than viewing closed captioning as an accessible copy of one text, Boyle and Rivers identify differences in design, composition, and medium and see the close captioning as a new version. More than a merely reproducing an image in its likeness, then, a 3D print ought to be understood as an ontologically distinct assemblage of visual data – different in design, composition, and medium.</p>
<p>In creating 3D prints of Obama Hope, I too make new, ontologically distinct versions of this iconic image by engaging in the methodology of critical making<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Critical making emphasizes process-driven projects that experiment with form to learn more about an idea or object and encourage critical reflection about social matters. By designing and making 3D versions of Obama Hope, I show how a critical approach to 3D printing can diversify the invention process of making and open up new research approaches for digital visual studies. But more specifically, I aim to demonstrate how critical making can foreground difference to create an alternative way of seeing digital visual images, not just for people with disabilities but for everyone who experiences the object--a way of seeing that is as much tactile as traditionally visual. Garnet Hertz describes critical making as a process that creates “things to think with” (5). Here, I discuss and model how 3D printing creates “things to see with” and thus offers digital visual studies as a productive method for invigorating not just access but also accessibility to digital visual images.</p>
<p>To show how 3D printing can encourage such approaches to digital visual studies, this chapter begins with a theoretical explication of digital difference, accessibility, and embodied experience. I then discuss how critical making reframes doing digital visual studies – an approach that considers making as a tactile act of rhetorical invention. I then move to 3D printing and accessibility. Advances in technology have made 3D printing more available, but how has 3D printing participated in creating different, more accessible types of visual experiences? Finally, I demonstrate how 3D printing Obama Hope draws on the flexibility of digital images to create new versions and a new vision of accessibility. I emphasize, in particular, how critically tinkering with the Obama Hope through 3D printing enables embodied experiences that use “more than” optic sensors to make sense of visual data. In addition to discussing 3D printing and its affordances for digital visual studies, I also include photos and videos of my own making process and, in the appendix, invite readers to participate in the critical work of transforming visual images into 3D models and material objects. Building on what Jentry Sayers calls a ‘tinker-centric pedagogy,’ readers have the opportunity to engage critical making and discover how to contribute to communities of 3D models. I especially encourage making your own 3D printed versions of digital images to develop your own conclusions and better understand the tools, technologies, and diverse experiences that come with critical making.</p>
<p>I would like to note that while my work draws upon visual studies, writing studies, disability studies, and science and technology studies to open up new means of access and accessibility for diverse bodies, I am not advocating 3D printing or critical making as a cure all for issues of accessibility. Nor am I ignoring the many visual components of 3D technologies. Instead, I offer a research approach that is more than just visual – a methodology that uses difference productively to emphasize how emerging technological practices such as 3D printing can help scholars and designers generate embodied ways of sense-making that are beneficial to diverse bodies – regardless of their visual abilities. In prioritizing difference and using a “more than” approach, I hope to create opportunities for others to discover new versions of access, and their own meanings, through critical making. In making, tinkering, and overall – just doing it – we practice rhetorical invention and learn through the embodied, lived experience of doing digital visual study.</p>
<p><strong>Making Hope: Visions of Accessibility for Every Body</strong></p>
<p><em>“In her biography of Picasso, Gertrude Stein observes that what changes over time is what is seen and what is seen results from how everybody’s doing everything. What is seen depends on what there is to see and how we look at it.” -- George Roeder</em></p>
<p>All bodies and experiences are different, so how we do digital visual studies should encourage difference and account for multiple ways of seeing and experiencing visual data. Prioritizing accessibility in digital visual studies invites us to rethink not only how rhetoric shapes scholarly discourse about bodies (and vice versa <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>) but also the relationships between technologies, visual information, and embodied experiences. Frequently, <em>access</em> is framed in terms of availability, if people have the computers, software, or tools needed to get or produce information. On the other hand, <em>accessibility</em> involves how humans process and engage information. Sushil K. Oswal argues, “accessibility can be defined as the ability to use, enjoy, perform, work on, avail of, and participate in a resource, technology, activity, opportunity, or product at an equal or comparable level with others” (2013). Yet, ideas of equality (as great as that sounds) also imply normative values. Who decides what is equal? How do we compare? Instead of attempting to create equal access to a text or experience, I suggest thinking about accessibility as designing for difference; designing, in other words, in a way that doesn’t assume a static text or a static body. Disability studies, in particular, reminds us to challenge ideas of normative bodies and practices of processing information. As Cynthia Lewiecki-Wilson and Brenda Jo Brueggeman explain, “disability studies asks us to think carefully about language and its effects, to understand the role of the body in learning and writing, to view bodies and minds as inherently and wonderfully divergent, to consider issues of access and exclusion in policies and in the environment, and to re-engage with theories of difference and diversity” (1). As we use emerging technologies to study or share, we need to consider research methods and methodologies that consider multiple ways of accessing, understanding, and engaging with visual data - approaches that foreground bodily difference and accessibility.</p>
<p>Recent work by rhetoric, composition, and disability scholars model approaches that move beyond traditionally verbal/visual means to consider multisensory ways of seeing and knowing. For example, Shannon Walters book <em>Rhetorical Touch</em> rereads ancient rhetoric through disability studies and argues for understanding touch as a rhetorical art that reshapes the traditional rhetorical appeals. Walters examines haptic technologies to decenter primarily visual modes of analysis and emphasizes that “the sense of touch is not simply a neutral or natural interface that seamlessly connects bodies and technologies but is overlaid with assumptions about bodies, minds, and interactions” —assumptions that are always changing (179). Singling out any one sense or perspective limits how we can interact with digital technologies and often privileges one version of a text or user. Accessibility is not merely about difference, open access, or technological advances, but engaging the diverse lived experiences of people and the multisensory ways we process visual information.</p>
<p>For a few, universal design offers an “ideal” approach. Typically, when adapting a text, image, or space to create accessibility, a normative body becomes standard and principles of design focus on removing barriers to accommodate anyone who is different. As Melanie Yergeau notes, “To accommodate is to retrofit; it is to assume normative bodies as default and to build spaces and infrastructures around those normative default bodies; it is to deal with deviant bodily and spatial conditions as they bubble out at the seams” (2014). Again, we can reference ideas of an original text and attempts to retrofit content through close captioning to make a text accessible for different users. Universal design, in contrast, focuses on designing products and spaces that are usable and beneficial to everyone, “not specifically people with disabilities, but all people” (Mace). Unfortunately, as Michael J. Salvo points out, universal design is an ideal and an impossibility – there is no such thing as a text that works for everyone (2013). In conjunction, focusing on human bodies ignores the nonhuman actants and diverse situations that also shape how we process information and interact with visual data. So how can digital visual studies apply design principles to digital resources and make content more compatible with multiple types of devices, a diverse community of users, and evolving ideas of accessibility?</p>
<p>I propose we move on from ideas of “universal” or “ideal” and build on the work of designing for the lived experience of accessibility through critical making approaches. Building on the work of new materialism, design studies, science and technology studies, and information systems, Matt Ratto coined the term critical making to describe “the combination of critical thinking with hands-on making—a kind of pedagogical practice that uses material engagements with technologies to open up and extend critical social reflection” (Conversations in Critical Making). Similar to practices of critical design (Dunne and Raby 2013) or participatory design, the hands-on practice of critical making challenges universal, human-centered prototypes and instead translates social or political questions into material forms to demonstrate the complex relationships between images and objects as well as technology and society. Much like the versioning of Boyle and Rivers, and the digital images of Hansen, critical making also forwards design as part of the meaning making process, emphasizes lived experience, and encourages multiple versions of seeing and knowing. In designing for lived experiences, we abandon universalizing ontologies and embrace possibility as part of accessibility, allowing for generative difference. In other words, through critical making, we resist norms, ideals, and standards and create room for alternative experiences that work for a specific situation. For example, when designing a prosthetic so that a child with a missing limb can play tennis, we don’t have to create a hand that can hold a racket, but instead can create a prosthetic that is a racket. Instead of retrofitting or accommodating a norm or original, designers can create in ways that embrace difference. Such foregrounding is especially important in that, here, accessibility is perceived as a <em>problem of design</em> rather than a problem of human bodies.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> By critically tinkering with designs, we can explore diverse experiences of visual data and invent new sense-making methods for doing digital visual study.</p>
<p>Critical making offers more accessible approaches to doing digital visual study by emphasizing process over product, which prioritizes ideas of difference and lived experience from the start. Instead of focusing exclusively on end products or default users, critical making uses the process of creation to examine and generate material-semiotic relationships within and between socio-technical environments. Flipping traditional approaches to visual analysis, critical making asks, “what can I learn from doing” and “how can I create something that illustrates a specific idea or purpose?” Thus, the making process is one of discovery and invention, a creative inquiry that can change and adapt to diverse circumstances. Accessibility is an ever changing concept, always constructed as a part of a “network of activities” particular to a body, place, time, and purpose (Spinuzzi, 193). By prioritizing accessibility and embracing difference, critical making calls into question a default text, image, body, technology, and/or even method. There is no one way, one text, authoritative “aura,” or single entry point to access knowledge. Instead, makers experiment with design and discover different ways to see, sense, and understand through the process of making.</p>
<p>Following disability studies call to explore new languages and embodied difference, critical making also creates opportunities to study images, objects, and technologies in ways that move beyond primarily optical iterations. Sarah Ganz Blythe, Director of Education at the RISD Museum, advocates “learning from objects as primary sources by looking, analyzing, and contextualizing. Such learning helps us form a language for communicating responses to art and design, and in turn fosters the creation of art and design objects that speak their own language” (Somerson, 24). But learning and language already involve more than looking, and as such should also encourage more than optical methods of study, especially if we are designing for difference and accessibility. Critical making helps to frame digital accessibility as an emerging literacy practice that can shape how we engage new technologies for doing digital visual study. Shifting the focus from an end product or text to process and production helps to generate embodied, multisensory experiences. With 3D printing, even in clicking on designs, rotating models, or printing samples, users move, feel, and interact with digital data in different, physical ways. Such experiences also highlight the multifaceted kinds of labor that go into creating objects of study. The embodied work of remixing an image, making a video, or modeling an object is always more than just visual. However, youtube tutorials, makeover shows, pinterest boards, and even scholarly publications tend emphasize finished products and optical engagement. Critical making, on the other hand, draws attention to the tactical, laborios production process of image making and the embodied experiences and insights that emerge along the way. When adapting an image, makers, artists, and scholars must account for the techne (craft) of rendering a 3D model, but must also make decisions about representation and how best to display visual information. Figuring out how to represent visual data in 3D form, with the appropriate materials, to the correct scale, etc, changes with each iteration and attempt. When creating 3D prints, the modeling, sculpting, rotating, testing, revising, etc. involves handiwork by both humans and computer aided design (CAD). The CAD elements emphasize how doing digital visual study is a multi-sensory collaboration between human and non-human actants that shape a digital artifact. Computers might process aspects of an image and create a 3D render, but sculpting the model requires a user to move a mouse or touch a screen to refine the form. Printers heat up materials and move from point to point to physically build a 3D print, while participants slow down or speed up the process, touching and testing the materials to create specific effects. Monitoring the printing involves listening for a continuous hum and paying attention to any smells that might indicate burning or an error. Any editing or remix process is already embodied, but critical making focuses on the haptic work of research production - a process of labor that is always both mental and physical and dependent on multiple senses such as sight, touch, and even smell.</p>
<p>Critical making, in fact, might be best understood as a methodology that I call “sense-making” to understand, tinker, and invent. By sense-making, I mean the use of our physical senses to gather and understand information. Critical making invites users to think outside of traditional language-based methodologies and use our senses to create, both for ourselves and others, embodied, multisensory experiences with technologies. For instance, to revise Obama Hope, I tinkered with different tools and technologies that could help reframe the image and create a texture and topography that is both seen <em>and</em> felt. Once I decided on a 3D printed version of Obama Hope, I experimented with materials and form to see how changing variables changed the way people experienced the image. I started with an image of Obama, inverted the curvature of the face, translated the different colors into wavelengths of light, and printed each iteration so that I could both see and touch different versions of the digital visual data. Altering color, texture, and content, I played with the flexibility of the image to create a version that best fit my specific purpose - to display the visual data in a new way that encourages different ways of seeing. This process may sound a little touchy-feely, but that is exactly the point. Critical making encourages us to use our hands, to reframe how we approach data, and to incorporate different sensory modes to refine knowledge and challenge normative assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5: 3D printed lithophane of Barack Obama at three angles showing texture &amp; light</strong></p>
<p>While critical making emphasizes process over product, I argue that critical making also draws attention to how materials matter. In <em>Still Life with Rhetoric,</em> Gries advocates for moving beyond thinking of images as representations or even signs and instead to focus on their thingness, their ability to both materialize and generate material consequences as other bodies and entities enter into relations with them. Critical making can assist such efforts by generating 3d things that become not only objects of study, but powerful agents, in their own right, that can transform and (re)assemble the social, challenging normative views and values. A 3D printed Obama Hope becomes an actant for change with regard to accessibility communities like Thingiverse. While many remixes of Obama Hope exist in 2D form, Thingiverse has over 60 3D models that feature an image of President Obama - from printable phone cases with Obama Hope and new versions of Mount Rushmore, to animal remakes of Obama like the Obama -lama and Bracatapus. These 3D models might seem a bit diverse and perhaps even ridiculous, but they also illustrate the many versions of images that can circulate through dynamic digital ecologies.</p>
<p><img src="media/image8.png" style="width:2.27675in;height:1.94375in" /><img src="media/image9.png" style="width:1.85088in;height:1.94455in" /><img src="media/image10.png" style="width:1.94684in;height:1.90771in" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 6: 3D printed designs of Barack Obama on Thingiverse – a Mount Rushmore with Obama, 3D printed lithophane, phone cases, Baracktopus, and Obama Llama</strong></p>
<p>Along these same new materialist lines, critical making helps turn attention the complex ecology of entities that are always at play in production - the diverse tools, technologies, and networks help create, transform, and circulate image objects of invention. For example, creating and revising models such as Obama Hope highlights how digital visual artifacts emerge through dynamic ecologies that involve multiple bodies, devices, materials, platforms, storage sites, and networks. Such experiences draw attention to the larger material impacts beyond what one individual can see or touch - from the power used to run a 3D printer, to the cloud storage for photoshop accounts, to the discarded drafts that end up as waste. And in demanding tactile engagement with such entities, critical making encourages a social-material approach in which critical thinking balances the socio-technical experience of making things, with potential to intervene in emerging technical landscapes and lived experiences. As such, I argue, critical making opens up opportunities to understand and experience the relationships between bodies, technologies, information, and visual things - relationships that are always different for each body that enters into them.</p>
<p>Critical making will not fix all the issues surrounding accessibility, however, the making process challenges scholars to consider alternate points of view, embodied experiences, and new ways of creating knowledge. Admittedly, critical making is a hopeful process, a methodology that embraces difference as a site for rhetorical invention and scholarly inquiry in the hopes of creating more accessible experiences for diverse bodies. However, making is not about demonstrating expertise, but about the hands-on, trial and error process of experimentation. Failure is always part of the knowledge process and important to learning through doing. As such, critical making is also skeptical of cure-all solutions or practice makes perfect ideologies. The making process is not just about producing one perfect thing, or working with one sense, but going through the process repeatedly, as a sense-making <em>practice</em> that can change and evolve with each version. Senses change, bodies change, even what we know changes - so too must the ways we study digital images. By experimenting with designs, critical making explores different ways of understanding images and fosters diverse possibilities for doing digital visual studies. 3D printing, I argue, is a particularly productive critical making practice in that it can simultaneously make new versions of digital visual images, open up different sensory experiences for viewers, and investigate how emerging technology influences social relations (i.e. becomes rhetorical).</p>
<p><strong>3D Printing Change: Sense-making Methods</strong></p>
<p><em>"A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything."</em></p>
<p><em>Barack Obama, State of the Union, 2013</em></p>
<p>Recent advances in 3D printing position the technology as a unique point of access/ability: increasingly more people have access to 3D technologies and increasingly 3D technologies are being used to create accessible experiences for different people. Beginning with rapid prototyping in the late 1980s and then additive manufacturing in the 1990s, 3D printing has moved from the industrial to the individual through the popularity of maker movements. The maker movement refers to a tech-influenced DIY community that began to emerge in the mid 2000s. The invention of affordable, easily hackable technology and open source software instigated a new type of DIY citizenship built from the hybrid economy of material, conceptual, and digital production. Makerspaces or fabrication labs (FabLabs) often participate in education initiatives to encourage individuals to “make stuff” and provide open access to lab equipment and tutorials for 3D technologies. Collecting in makerspaces or through online forums, the maker movement’s drive to tinker with new technologies and the growing culture of computing has generated grassroots innovation and influenced market demand. By encouraging people to tinker with technology, maker culture has not only brought updates and innovation to the market, but also dramatically lowered the cost of making technologies. Personal 3D printers that were around $10,000 in 2007 are now under $300 (Amazon.com). In conjunction, open source software such as <em>123Dcatch, Tinkercad, Meshmixer, Sketchfab</em>, and <em>Thingiverse</em> offer free online platforms for making, remixing, and sharing 3D models. Schools, libraries, and public institutions are also using 3D technologies to expand educational outreach and provide increased access to visual data. Unveiled in 2013, for instance, the Smithsonian X 3D Explorer lets users rotate, zoom in, and engage with 3D models of some of the most iconic artifacts in the museum - from fossils and flowers to the Wright brothers plane and presidential busts (https://3d.si.edu). Visitors to the site can also download and print the digital data in material form, enabling a new type of study and hands on learning. Due to such advances, 3D technologies have become a viable arena for taking advantage of the flexibility and accessibility of digital images, enabling multiple ways of seeing and experiencing, and opening up new ways of doing digital visual study.</p>

<p><strong>Video 1: Description of 3D printing and common uses</strong></p>
<p>Using the Obama Hope image, this project demonstrates how 3D technologies and a critical making approach can generate embodied, multisensory ways of doing digital visual study. My critical making process began with the question “How can I make a version of Obama Hope that designs for lived experiences and encourages different, more tactile ways of seeing?” As a person with 20/30 vision, my lived experience of visual data is similar to some, different than others. But my specific goal with this sense-making experiment was to reframe what (and how) we see, to disrupt normative experiences of visual imagery, and translate questions about accessibility into material forms. As previously discussed, prioritizing lived experience opens up possibilities for new, alternative ways of seeing and knowing. In 3D printing Obama Hope, I am not trying to make an accessible version that <em>accommodates</em> bodily difference. Instead, my designs <em>create</em> different, multisensory experiences of the visual data that reframes how people encounter the image.</p>
<p>In order to generate multisensory experiences, I tinkered with different tools and technologies to redesign Obama Hope and create a texture and topography that is both seen <em>and</em> felt. I first experimented with materials and form (plastics, wood, paper, metal) to see how changing variables changed the experience of Obama Hope. Playing with materials and remaking Obama Hope’s visual data helped me understand how light, color, and shape create visual markers that can be translated into tactile experiences. Ultimately, I decided to create a 3D printed lithophane to reframe how we experience the image and challenge normative ways of seeing. Historically, artists created lithophanes in thin porcelain and etched an image that can only be seen clearly when lit from behind (See Figure below).</p>

<p>The thinner areas let in more light while thicker portions create a contrast and appear darker. The monochromatic contrast conveys depth and perspective to create a full image (Carney). Carved into porcelain, a lithophane also has a distinct topography that transforms a traditional visual form into a multisensory experience. To see the image, a lithophane must be picked up, repositioned, and angled toward a light. As such, lithophanes engender tactile experiences as part of the looking process.</p>
<p>To create a 3D printed tactile experience, a designer must consider how light plays a role in images, how to best represent visual markers, and how digital technologies affect design and composition. Similar to how sound wave visualizations help us “see” sound, 3D lithophanes can help us make objects that allow people to touch light and dark. First, I had to reconfigure Obama Hope’s iconic colors, outline, and shading to fit the monochromatic lithophane look and 3D printing process. Traditional porcelain lithophanes carve out materials in a subtractive process, but 3D printing is an additive process that creates layers. Re-vising texture and light in 3D printing translates to building up some areas of a print with multiple layers to create height, while leaving other areas low and thin. Building height in a 3D object is called extruding, pulling part of a model up or out. Like traditional lithophanes, the thin areas let in light, while the thicker (extruded) areas create a dark contrast. When lit from behind, the different layers of the 3D printed lithophane create contrast and show the contours of the Obama Hope image. However, when you shift the perspective and look at the lithophanes from the side, the juxtaposition of thick and thin layers resembles a mountain range of hills and valleys that you can both see and touch.</p>

<p>Several websites offer free 3D print lithophane generators that allow users to alter models, so the process of making becomes accessible, tinker-centric, and community based. To create my 3D printed lithophane, I used <a href="http://3dp.rocks/lithophane/"><span class="underline">http://3dp.rocks/lithophane/</span></a>, a program that transforms flat photos into lithophanes that can be downloaded and printed. I adapted both the original photo by Mannie Garcia as well as the Shepard Fairey’s Obama Hope design, and made four Obama lithophanes with a public access university printer and common 3D printing plastic.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I (critically) made multiple versions for two reasons. First, I needed to learn more about how the materiality of an image shapes its visual form, including how computers process visuals to create depth, contour, and other aspects that indicate a three-dimensional object. Second, I wanted to experiment with how different versions would encourage different sense-making experiences. With each version, I altered variables to discover how factors like contrast, extrusion, or composition changed the sensory experience of the resulting 3D object. Since my goal was to create different sensory experiences of the Obama Hope image, I tinkered with the height of each lithophane and exaggerated visual elements so that the iconic color and shading of the Obama images could be felt in the printed peaks and valleys and encourage tactile ways of looking.</p>

<p><strong>Video 2: Example lithophanes of Obama portrait and Obama Hope showing how to tinker with tactility</strong></p>
<p>When I show people my 3D version of Obama Hope, the first question asked is, “how should I look at it?” quickly followed by “can I touch it?” In “looking,” people experience the lithophanes quite differently, with some focusing on how to make sense of the print, others testing the spiky peaks, and others asking about how I made the image. To make sense of Obama Hope3D, people pick up the lithophanes, hold the print sideways to study the peaks and valleys, and finally move around to catch the light. Only when people handle the print and hold it up to light can they see Obama Hope and all the details and dimensions that go into creating the visual. However, even when not lit from behind, the lithophane still leaves an imprint, a topography that individuals can see and touch. In this way, the extreme variations created in the 3D print challenge people to use multiple senses to make sense of the visual data while calling into question a normative view.</p>
<p>3D prints such as Obama Hope also draw attention to the making process, which illuminates the process of vision itself. People ask, “How did you make this?” and question how the 3D process transformed the visual data without distorting the image. They specifically want to know how I transformed visual aspects such as Obama’s skin and hairline and Fairey’s shading and graphics into tactile structures that look so different from the original yet remain recognizable. Such inquiries are exactly what critical making hopes to generate, as it is through such discussions about process that we come to better understand not only the images at hand, but also the sense making act of vision itself.</p>
<p>The making of 3D printed versions of Obama Hope, for instance, helps articulate many of the details and dimensions of visual data that often go unnoticed, the details that can help highlight the unique assemblages of distinct versions. As a flat image, Obama Hope presents one version of visual data - the bold colors, smoothed out facial features, and outlined forms, etc. However, as a 3D print, Obama Hope reveals more of the unique features - the structure and shadows, the heights and depths that are encoded in visual data to make up the image, features that make each version different. Similar to an MRI or even a microscope, making with 3D print technologies creates a different experience of the visual data that goes beyond surface level analysis and enables artists, scholars, and perhaps even lawyers to understand Obama Hope in a new way. For example, when Shepard Fairey released Obama Hope, the Associated Press claimed copyright infringement and criticized Fairey for altering Mannie Garcia’s original photo of President Obama without obtaining their permission. In turn, Fairey claimed fair use and argued that “he had effectively transformed the work into an idealized image ‘that created powerful new meaning and conveys a radically different message’” (New York Times, Dunlap 2011). The legal battle went on for years and scrutinized concepts of remix, artistic interpretation and especially fair use. Transforming the Obama Hope image into a 3D model illustrates how Fairey’s version <em>is</em> distinct from Garcia’s photo. When 3D printed, Garcia’s photo results in numerous peaks and valleys, each rising and falling to mimic the proportions of President Obama’s face, his hairline, and even the tone and texture of his skin. However, in Obama Hope, the 3D print reveals more of a block outline, a result of Fairey’s shading, color use, and remix of the image to create a different, graphic version. By approaching the visual data as a tactile experience, one can more clearly see <em>and feel</em> the difference between the two images. Ironically, by remaking the image into a different, multisensory experience, we can see how Obama Hope is an original creation, perhaps inspired by Garcia’s photo, but distinct in composition and style. Perhaps, if the lawyers had approached the image as a multisensory experience, everyone could have avoided such a lengthy debate and instead reconsidered how we define fair use. But even more importantly, by approaching visional data as an embodied experience and decentering normative ways of seeing, we can shift the conversation from defending originality to celebrating difference.</p>
<p>Making a 3D Obama Hope into a multisensory experience also emphasizes new types of access <em>and</em> accessibility created by the flexibility of digital images. Technologies already augment the way that we see images and objects, from reading glasses to photocopy machines. However, as Sean Zadnek points out, electronic texts are extremely powerful as “presentation neutral,” which means they can be altered and rendered to best fit individual lived experiences (7). Digital technologies open up new multisensory ways of engaging digital images, ways that celebrate difference in their ability to transform “visually, auditorily, tactilely, or any other combination” according to the sensory needs of diverse users (World Wide Web Consortium, 2016). For example, technologies such as screen readers can speak text, voice inputs can create braille displays, texts can be enlarged, and touch based screens create new types of interactions with digital data that traditional images, audio, and video lack.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Similarly, 3D printing technologies enable users to transform a flat image such as Obama Hope into a 3D model that create multiple ways to interact with the image - zooming, rotating, sculpting, touching etc. However, 3D print technologies not only diversify experiences of digital images but also diversify making practices for users with different communication abilities. 3D modeling software and printing programs are partnering with communities to create multisensory platforms that use Braillers or auditory commands to interact with visual data. For instance, OpenSCAD uses auditory commands to create 3D models and Yahoo Japan recently created a voice activated 3D printer that helps translate text descriptions into printed artifacts. A new “hands on search” function even responds to auditory printing requests, physically producing an elephant or toy car on demand (<a href="http://award.aid-dcc.com/yahoo/en/">http://award.aid-dcc.com/yahoo/en/</a>). Such 3D printing innovations challenge visual studies to account for the multiple ways that digital technologies already transform visual images into sense-making experiences.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, critical making Obama Hope helps demonstrate the multiplicity of visual experience and account for the dynamic ecologies that come to constitute vision itself. The Obama Hope 3D, for instance, creates an experience for both maker and audience that reframes how visual images can engender multisensory experiences and draws attention to the dynamic ecology of vision. While we normally think of vision as a bodily experience, local to our eyes and biological systems, our body is only one factor in the ecology of what constitutes how and what we see. Technologies shape our exposure to images and factors such as light and form constantly change and affect visual experiences. For example, if I walk into a dark room with 100 people, none of us can see, regardless of the strength of our eyes or sensory abilities. The tactile experience of Obama Hope accentuates light and form and challenges us to think outside of our bodies and to consider the multiple material, environmental facets also at play within visual experiences. When we invite people to approach an image from a different perspective, one that accounts for multiple senses and environmental factors, they have to look differently, see differently, and think about vision differently. When we decenter bodies in general and re engage vision from alternative practices, we also reframe visual study to better account for accessibility - thinking about how different bodies and dynamic ecologies of people, technology, and senses work together to see, study, and understand visual data.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Artist, critical maker, and President of the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), Rosanne Somerson insists scholars incorporate methods “that include hands-on practice, the processing of enhanced seeing and perception, and contextualized understanding” to better analyze the meaning making that occurs with objects and by objects (19). In this chapter, I have addressed this call by introducing critical making approaches to 3D printing to better engage accessibility within digital visual studies. Digital technologies increasingly offer embodied, multisensory ways to interact with images, ways that change how we process information and participate in making new knowledge. To better understand how digital images create diverse, embodied experiences, I designed, modeled, and 3D printed multiple versions of Obama Hope, each version playing on the flexibility of digital data to create an experience of the image that could be both seen and felt. My versions re-envision Obama Hope as a tactile artifact that troubles traditional ways of seeing and demonstrate the potential of hands on practices such as critical making to decenter normative ways of seeing in favor of diverse lived experiences. Prioritizing difference and possibility, critical making challenges people to ask questions, experiment with ideas, and, I argue, better understand how our senses shape our embodied experiences. As such, 3D printing Obama Hope invites us to question how ecologies, bodies, technologies, and materials work together to make sense of digital visual data.</p>
<p>Through 3D printing, we not only have the opportunity to study images, but we can also directly participate in the production and circulation of made objects. Once I completed my 3D print of Obama Hope, I uploaded the model to Thingiverse and added to the many versions of Obama Hope circulating in that community. (<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2926975"><span class="underline">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2926975</span></a>). In a few short months, my model had 363 views, 66 downloads, and was part of 6 different collections that sparked new communities. As the 3D prints of Obama Hope circulate through the Thingiverse community and are downloaded, remixed, and recirculated, they become things in flow - things that, as Gries describes, are still rhetorically active and undergoing change. In this way, a single thing, like Obama Hope, becomes multiple, on the move, and a participant in an unknown number of rhetorical transformations. As a 3D print, Obama Hope connects to new publics and is ready to undergo rhetorical transformations for new causes. In addition, 3D printing communities such as Thingiverse or Sketchfab offer new additions to the dynamic ecologies already at work and create new types of flexibility that open up opportunities to participate in the work of digital visual study. As part of the Thingiverse community, my lithophane becomes a site of invention where other users and technologies can make and remake through their own sense-making methods. Similar to how Obama Hope became a site to educate people about Fair Use, the image once again takes on an educational role to demonstrate new methods for studying visual data, methods that instigate possibility and make room for multisensory approaches.</p>
<p>Lastly, and most importantly, while 3D printing is just one way to study, produce, and enhance circulation of digital visual images, I reemphasize that designing, modeling, and making 3D prints challenges participants to tinker, invent, and discover new sense making ways of creating knowledge. In making multiple 3D printed versions of Obama Hope that can be both seen and felt, I hope we can “see” how vision is an embodied experience, more than merely optical, but a multisensory process of understanding information. Rather than position critical making or 3D printing as a cure all, I position it as a site of possibility and invention for doing digital visual study that puts difference at the forefront of both design and analysis. When we advocate for such alternative approaches, we leverage the flexibility of digital data to expand the possibilities for what visual studies can do, as well as how we can do it. To more deeply engage in the flexibility and accessibility of digital images, digital visual study must encourage multiple versions, diverse lived experiences, and more embodied ways of seeing and knowing. We especially need to consider how decentering normative bodies and designing for difference might bring concepts like accessibility to the fore and create more inclusive approaches without creating a hierarchy of knowledge or privileging specific practices. In making (obama) hope and 3D printing change, we celebrate difference as integral for understanding access/ability and embodied digital experiences.</p>

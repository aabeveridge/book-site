          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><b>Centralization, Infrastructure, and Institutions</b></p>
          <p>What were the enabling conditions for the spread of the Obama Hope image? In an interview, creator Shepard Fairey attributes it to a kind of grassroots movement supported by motivated individuals and the Internet. This account is certainly partially correct in that grassroots dynamics, motivated individuals, and the Internet <em>did</em> contribute to the ubiquity of Obama Hope. However, it is worth emphasizing the partiality of such account; while the overall spread of the image could be characterized as a grassroots phenomenon, a number of influential centralizing organizational forces remained at work, such as the official Obama campaign. Commercial entities such as <em>Paste Magazine</em> also played a key role in Obama Hope’s broad circulation because, in producing Obamicon.me, <em>Paste</em> provided easy-to-use image generation, sharing, and web hosting. As Laurie Gries notes, the website was one among many digital technologies available to create your own Obama Hope style image, but “Obamicon.me differentiated itself from other Obamifying technologies in allowing Obamicons either to be saved onto visitors’ computers via a simple right click and then uploaded to Flickr or Facebook, which many people have done, or archived and shared in the obamicon.me gallery so that comments can be made in response to an image and links can be established” (Gries 2015, 253). Although “the Internet” was certainly involved in the viral success of the image, the creation of streamlined tools to generate images and social platforms to share images introduces significantly more centralization than the phrase itself might suggest.</p>
          <p>The instant and immediate removal of millions of user-generated Obamicons shows how, despite the accounts of decentralization that dominate discussions of user-generated content and virality, centralization is in some ways more salient on the web than in other physical spaces. Compare the spreading of the Obama Hope image through the more traditional means of street art: pasting and graffiti. This approach is carried out by individuals or small collectives of individuals and requires more time and materials from the individual, whether prints and paste or paints. It also often entails a degree of personal risk for the individual, as many places have regulations against the spread of street art. Once placed, the image is subject to a variable life span depending on the content and the area and the interests of property owners, police officers, street artists, and others. While it is likely that images created and collected at Obamicon.me outlived a majority of their street counterparts with the site remaining online through 2013, there are very different dynamics of control at work with images on the Internet. An Obama Hope image pasted on a wall is subject to local jurisdiction and distributed factors such as regulations, traffic, neighborhood dynamics, interest and means of enforcement, the weather, and so on. An image created and hosted on Obamicon.me is subject to more centralized control, living and dying according to the corporation that holds the servers.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
          <p>Many aspects of digital visual culture are networked, and it is important to pay attention to the characteristics of this network. If images are hosted on a single platform, that platform is subject to the actions of a corporation and will be available only as long as the interests of the corporation are served keeping it online. As Jill Lepore cautions, “a lot of people do believe that if it’s on the Web it will stay on the Web. Chances are, though, that it actually won’t” (Lepore 2015). Consider the takedown or substantial transformation of other web platforms such as GeoCities and MySpace, where entire online communities now only exist in fragments, saved to individual computers, as cached pages, or in archived but unorganized collections. Likewise, consider the controversial policy changes that image hosting service Photobucket implemented in June of 2017, when the company disabled the free hosting of images on third party sites and required users to pay an annual fee of $399 (US). The service, which has been around since 2003, removed hosted images and replaced them with an image of a speedometer and the message that “Your account has been restricted for 3<sup>rd</sup> party hosting” and an urge to upgrade membership. These error message images now litter websites and online marketplaces like Etsy and eBay, as most users have refused to upgrade their accounts (Garun 2017). While the spread of viral images may be partially attributed to grass roots phenomena, especially with the distribution of people involved, the case of Obamicon.me shows an important way in which centralizing forces are at work in digital visual culture, with political implications.</p>
          <p>Although the web has signaled a move away from the primacy of media institutions like broadcast television and the press, circulation (and its failure) continues to depend on institutions—just not those we might expect. Consider the institutions guiding the web, the sets of standards that make pages load consistently and globally, the commercial institutions that get in on trends, finding ways to try and monetize them. The huge spike in web traffic on Obamicon.me was one that generated advertising revenue, that could lead users to other <em>Paste Magazine</em> content, that could help contribute to the relevance of the brand (FOLIO: Magazine Staff 2009). When those goals are no longer being met, the company can (and did) pull the content and features offline. While the collection of Obamicons are an important part of the cultural heritage of Obama’s election and presidency (L. E. Gries 2015), did fuel partisan divides and support dog-whistle politics (L. Gries 2015), did represent a facet of the democratization of online activism (Bayerl and Stoynov 2016) and did serve as an exemplary of remix culture on the web (Edwards 2011), these circumstances were not salient to the institutions and infrastructure that enabled such diverse functions. As a commercial entity, <em>Paste</em> was mainly, if not solely, concerned with Obamicon.me for the ways it did (and later did not) contribute to the profitability of the magazine. This is not to say that Obamicons did not perform import cultural and political functions, but rather that these functions were dependent, at least in part, on technological infrastructures built and supported by underlying economic imperatives.</p>

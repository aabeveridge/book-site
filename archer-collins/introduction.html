          <p class="chaptertitle"><b>Circulating into place:</b></p>
          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><b>Using Virtual Geosemiotics to Find Context Dependent Meaning in Obama Hope</b></p>
          <p>In <em>Still Life with Rhetoric, </em>Gries (2015) traces the circulation of Shepard Fairey’s, now iconic, Obama Hope image and explores how the image spread throughout the world in a variety of different mediums. Using her new method of iconographic tracking, Gries’ work is extremely helpful in understanding the national and global influence of the image. Yet although the book features some longer explanation of local uptakes of the Obama Hope image, the book generally focuses on the broad strokes of the circulation and transformation. Our chapter seeks to zoom in and take a close look at localized uses of the Obama Hope image through a virtual geosemiotic approach. We are particularly interested in the deployment of the Obama Hope image in murals found in Larose, Louisiana and in Orgosolo, Italy. Whereas Obama Hope communicates a sense of positive forward momentum in certain contexts, in Larose and Orgosolo, things take an ominous turn<em>.</em></p>
          <p>Geosemiotics, as described by Scollon and Scollon (2003), is “the study of the social meaning of the material placement of signs and discourses and of our actions in the material world” (p. 2). Geosemiotics as envisioned by Scollon and Scollon (2003), includes three interconnected fields of inquiry: social interaction orders, visual semiotics and place semiotics. The interaction order is a concept borrowed from Erving Goffman’s (1959, 1963, 1971) studies of behavior in public spaces. These classic works in nonverbal communication provide a social spine for the study of geosemiotics, which assumes that places are characterized by the social interactions that take place therein. Additionally, by observing behavior in place relating to sense of time, perceptual spaces, interpersonal distances, and personal fronts, the geosemiotician can establish a sense of how signs will be read by people in the space, and how certain behaviors will operate as indexical signs for other actors in the space. The next phase of analysis in a typical geosemiotic study takes into account the visual semiotics of images that index the “world in which they are placed” and “how social actors index these images which are so abundant” (p. Scollon &amp; Scollon, p. 84). At some stage, a geosemiotician must wield the tools of garnering meaning from visual images that are borrowed from Gunther Kress and Theo Van Leuwen (1996, 2001). Finally, in terms of place semiotics, the place itself, whether built up or wild, must be analyzed for the qualities that interact with the social and visual signage that are in constant dialogue.</p>
          <p>Geosemiotics, as you can see here, is preoccupied with the indexable world. Whereas, symbolic meaning definitively exceeds the resources available in the physical scene, indexical meaning resides firmly in the interaction of signifying elements; the pointing to or away from, the positioning over and above, the depiction of the local or otherwise. For Scollon and Scollon (2003), the most important dimension of indexicality is the assumption that “a sign only has its meaning because of where it is placed in the world” (p. 29). This principle of indexicality opens up the potential for multiple readings of the Obama Hope image as its meaning is not stable across different landscapes and communities. Furthermore, the meaning of Obama Hope does not reside in the image but in the interaction between it and the signs that surround it, whether in the form of localizable social interaction orders, and/or other images in the landscape. This principle is termed dialogicity by Scollon and Scollon (2003) and is defined simply as the assumption that “all signs operate in aggregate” (p. 205). The authors suggest that there is a double meaning to dialogicity: that the sign, when placed, references a specific discourse that informs that placement, but once placed, the sign interacts with other discourses in the forms of interaction orders and other place-based signage. In other words, dialogicity ensures that the sign, once out in the world, is no longer under the sole semiotic sovereignty of the placer. That sign is now part of an ecology of signs.</p>
          <p>Virtual geosemiotics, as we imagine it in this chapter, is necessarily lacking one of the three pillars of geosemiotics: the emplaced social interaction order. Instead we use visual semiotics and place semiotics with the help of Google Street View to access the dialogicity that Obama Hope is implicated within, both in Larose, Lousiana and Orgosolo, on the island of Sardinia to the west of Italy. In doing such research, we aim to demonstrate how geosemiotics as a visual research method can be supplemented with digital tools such as Google Street View to enhance our understanding of how place contributes to the meaning of visual artifacts. As evident in the spatial humanities, digital tools such as Google Earth and Google Maps are becoming more and more popular for doing research across disciplines. For instance, in human geography, De Vries et al. (2013) have used Google Maps to measure the social attractiveness of landmarks in the Netherlands based upon tagging behaviors of locals and visitors. We argue that digital tools such as Google Maps, Google Street View, and the practice of geotagging across platforms can also be useful to visual studies, especially for projects such as this one that are concerned with how murals and other visual artifacts are shaped by their emplacement.</p>
          <p>The applications of virtual geosemiotics can be much wider than the use of Google Street View by researchers. For example, access to images obtained by drone or satellite may be used to analyze semiotic ecologies in places that are inaccessible for a variety of reasons. For instance, the hurricane season of 2017 rendered certain islands in the Caribbean Sea inaccessible and in some cases unreachable by traditional communication technologies. Other areas in recent times that have been difficult to access have included Fukushima in Japan following the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant accident; Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea suffered Ebola outbreaks in 2014; and myriad places that have suffered debilitating military hostilities such as Iraq and Syria in 2017. As the earth becomes hotter in the 21<sup>st</sup> century we might reasonably expect that more places will become more difficult to access due to extreme weather events and conflict over resources. Virtual geosemiotics might be put to a variety of applications in these instances. For example, does effective signage exist in emergency situations, are there <em>signs</em> <em>of life</em> after catastrophes, and can we improve our own signifying environments in case of catastrophic events? We leave others to explore these potential future applications as we focus for the moment on developing pathways for virtual geosemiotics.</p>
          <p>The Obama Hope image comes in a variety of media in its variety of locations throughout the world. We have settled upon the two murals in Louisiana and Orgosolo, in part because mural as a medium lends itself to semiotics of place, due to their inscription upon physical walls of the city, and to visual semiotics due to their composition as visual forms. But we are also interested in these particular murals due to their function as sites of resistance. Prior studies in rhetoric regarding murals have focused on the ability of the medium to destabilize hegemonic spaces. Darrel Enck-Wanzer (2011), for instance, describes murals in El Barrio/East Harlem as “tactical interventions in the neoliberal metropolis” (p. 346). The Nuyorican murals are a part of an ensemble of material culture that espouse identity and resist complicity with dominant Anglo-American society by “generating identity possibilities” in the metropolis (p. 361). Enck-Wanzer also observes the use of murals by corporate agents to appeal to the Nuyorican regional aesthetic in order to garner their business. Needless to say that the mural as a medium can be hijacked for the needs of dominant interests but as Ferrell et al. (2008) argue, the battle for meaning between social movements and late capitalism is ongoing with victory never total. The battleground itself, the city walls, remain as a site of ongoing contestation.</p>
          <p>Mural and graffiti are so context dependent that to define them and render them as static objects would belie their nature as temporal phenomena inscribed, only for a time, on the urban landscape. Street art may be a better term to capture the fleeting essence of these forms. In this vein, Gillian Jein (2016) investigates the Parisian <em>banlieues</em>, experiencing the concurrent processes of gentrification, displacement, and segregation along the lines of class and race. In the Parisian context, the street art Jein analyses claims its own place in a space that is being restructured by government policy, which has inspired a rise in property values, and a bourgeois redistribution of the sensible. Following the work of Jacques Ranciere, Jein (2016) suggests that street art forms an interruption in the:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>police order, through its material performance of the ephemeral and aesthetic interruption of the smoothness of public architectures. It calls on the viewer to stop and look, creating pause in the flow of orderly departures and destinations that cause us very often to miss the cumulative presences that make urban space a public place. (p. 103)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In other words, murals and graffiti tend towards resisting dominant discourses or police orders to provide spaces of everyday life that may offer a pause from the grinding gears of the hegemonic order. The two murals we investigate here are similar in that, as you will see, they challenge a commonplace reading of the Obama Hope image. As such, these murals make for important studies in visual rhetoric and communication. In particular, by doing a virtual geosemiotic analysis of these two murals, we can reveal the changing valences of the Obama Hope image as it travels across the world. To achieve this perspective on Obama Hope, we consider some general geosemiotic principles before introducing our own virtual geosemiotic analysis. In such an analysis, the stable character of the text is challenged, and the mobile and mutable characteristics of the object’s rhetorical life are celebrated.</p>

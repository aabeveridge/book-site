          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><strong>Virtual Geosemiotics</strong></p>
          <p>A focus on circulation privileges movement and growth in the dissemination of an image, and geosemiotics slows the motion of circulation to see how a sign, a particular sign, serves a function of some kind, in a place. Scollon and Scollon (2003) explain: “when a sign makes its meaning by its geophysical placement, its physical characteristics, or its placement together with another sign or object we call that phenomenon indexicality” (p. 113). Geosemiotics is distinct from other approaches to space and place because of its preoccupation with the principle of indexicality. Regarding the Obama Hope image, when we find it in new contexts surrounded by dramatically different ecologies of signification, we want to provide a way of accounting for the changes that the object experiences as a result. In this spirit of geosemiotic inquiry, Bick and Chiper (2007) analyze how the Nike swoosh symbol is taken up in the different contexts of Romania and Haiti. The authors conduct their comparative study after spending time in each location on ethnographic immersions in the tradition of cultural anthropology. Resonances with our project are found in their approach to the semiotics of their places as typified by their fringe status on the edges of Western capitalism. Bick and Chiper (2007) suggest that the Nike swoosh in the outer reaches of the American empire, is a sign that offers a u-topic break from the everyday life of local concerns. The authors even argue that because the Nike swoosh is available to all in Haiti and Romania, its logic as a purveyor of capitalism is undermined. A sort of defiant joy in the production and consumption of the symbol exists completely aside from its totemic status as a signifier of the mega corporation. As such, we follow in the spirit of Bick and Chiper (2007) when we look for meanings that are emplaced, and unanticipated by the designs of Shepard Fairey. And yet, the big difference in our approaches concerns the position of the researcher. Whereas Bick and Chiper (2007) based their claims on extended periods of immersion in Haiti and Romania, we produce our claims based only on navigating the virtual spaces of Google Maps, Google Street View, and related geotagged visual artifacts.</p>
          <p>Initially, we scoured The Obama Hope Archive to select geographically and content-diverse murals for our case studies.  With over 1000 images in the archive and over a dozen murals, our choices were not meant to be exhaustive or even representative of the archive, but rather serve as case studies to illustrate how geosemiotics might expand our knowledge of the local, indexable, visual world. Broadly, we used geo-spatial technologies (GST) such as Google Earth and Google Maps, web searches of various media coverage, and reverse images searches to gain a comprehensive, virtual view of our selected murals in their original place. Using GST, particularly the street view on Google Maps, we were able to locate the exact coordinates of both murals. This technology also allows us to explore the area, neighborhood and town to help contextualize the ecology of local signs. This contextualizing work relies on the critic divining indexical links between images that are discovered in the online representational space. Indexical links also exist in the form geotags either using Google Maps or other platforms such as Instagram. Indexicality exists then in both the world rendered indexable by visual linking work of critics, and the virtual world that has been doing indexing work in the form of geotag. We believe that these virtual methods offer an opportunity for visual scholars, particularly those interested in emplacement, to study more signs within local semiotic ecologies.</p>
          <p>In this study we advocate for the use of virtual methods as a starting point for investigations that would otherwise call for <em>in situ</em> field work. Among a range of field studies in the humanities, as researchers, we adopt the most removed position from our site. In rhetorical field methods writ large, techniques range from interviewing key persons, observing action in the scene, photographing, writing extensive fieldnotes, using the critic’s body as a mediator of the physical environment and as a recording device for logging affective experiences. One could characterize studies in their commitments to (a): a community, as with studies that resemble ethnographies complete with <em>in situ</em> interviews that examine the interpretations of people (Na’puti, 2016; Pezzullo, 2003); (b): a commitment to space and its affective properties: these studies may not include any interviews or any interpretations other than the critic’s, but they do attend to the materialities immanent to the scene in a direct fashion (Blair, 1999; Dickinson, 2015); (c): and finally, virtual methods that seek to discover the affordances of digital techniques for the researcher. The commitment in virtual methods is not to a community or a material space, but a new space of representations that comprise a seemingly real, photographic world, and yet still offer up a particular way of seeing environments. We are not suggesting that virtual methods are more favorable for conducting fieldwork, but they deserve examination as an increasingly common way of experiencing spaces from afar. Our methodological commitment in this chapter is simply to explore the technology, not a community, or a material space per se.</p>

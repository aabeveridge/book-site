          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><strong>Virtual Geosemiotics</strong></p>
          <p>Virtual geosemiotics is a research method that uses geo-spatial technologies to locate and study images that take on context-dependent meanings in specific locales across the globe. In terms of our research process, we initially scoured Gries’s Obama Hope image data set to select geographically and content-diverse murals for our case studies. With over 1000 images in the data set and over a dozen murals, our choices were not meant to be exhaustive or even representative of the archive, but rather serve as case studies to illustrate how virtual geosemiotics might help expand our knowledge of the local, indexable, visual world and Obama Hope’s place in it. Broadly, we used geo-spatial technologies (GST) such as Google Earth and Google Maps, web searches of various media coverage, and reverse images searches to gain a comprehensive, virtual view of our selected Obama Hope murals in their original place. Using GST, particularly the street view on Google Maps, we were able to locate the exact coordinates of both murals. This technology also allowed us to explore the area, neighborhood and town to help contextualize the ecology of local signs.</p>
          <p>The following emplaced images are both remixes of Obama Hope composed in the medium of paint. <em>Obama-Berlusconi-Progress-Process</em> is a mural painted directly on to a wall in Orgosolo, Sardinia. Whereas <em>Obama What Now?</em> was painted onto a movable frame and displayed on the side of the Southern Sting Tattoo Shop in Larose, Louisiana. Both placements of these murals are suggestive of the tensions between the political periphery and center in the national context of the United States, and in the terms of the Italian state governing Sardinia from the mainland. The images and their geophysical placement offer scholars doing digital visual studies opportunities to examine the differing intonations and political valences that emerge as an image circulates and undergoes remix.</p>
          <p>In the course of investigating Larose and Orgosolo, we found a shifting semiotic aggregate, or concentration of localized meaning, the more we probed links in the data. The videos that accompany this chapter show how extended time spent navigating Google Street View reveals new indexical relations in the case of Orgosolo. And furthermore, Instagram became an invaluable resource when exposing the contradictory and sometimes troubling images emanating from the Southern Sting Tattoo Shop in Larose. Although images are always fragmentary and selective, the digital cuttings that we amassed during this investigative work were all glimpses—rather than immersions—of signifying ecologies. The accompanying videos show viewers how our research strategies unfold by using screen capture to put the viewer in the position of the virtual geosemiotic researcher. The medium of video is better able to capture these procedures that although are replicable, would be augmented depending on the online content available for a given case.</p>
          <p>The work of contextualizing an appearance of Obama Hope relies on the critic divining indexical links between images that are discovered in the online representational space. Indexical links also exist in the form geotags either using Google Maps or other platforms such as Instagram. Indexicality exists then in both the world rendered indexable by visual linking work of critics, and the virtual world that has been doing indexing work in the form of imagery that is indexed by the data rich practice of geotagging. We believe that this virtual method offer a productive opportunity for digital visual scholars, particularly those interested in emplacement, to study more signs within local semiotic ecologies.</p>
          <p>In this study we advocate for the use of virtual methods as a starting point for investigations that would otherwise call for <em>in situ</em> field work. In rhetorical field methods writ large, techniques range from interviewing key persons, observing action in the scene, photographing, writing extensive fieldnotes, using the critic’s body as a mediator of the physical environment and as a recording device for logging affective experiences. One could characterize studies in their commitments to (a): a community, as with studies that resemble ethnographies complete with <em>in situ</em> interviews that examine the interpretations of people (Na’puti; Pezzullo); (b): a commitment to space and its affective properties: these studies may not include any interviews or any interpretations other than the critic’s, but they do attend to the materialities immanent to the scene in a direct fashion (Blair; Dickinson); and (c), virtual methods that seek to discover the affordances of digital techniques for the researcher. The commitment in virtual methods is not to a community or a material space, but a new space of representations that comprise a seemingly real, photographic world, and yet still offer up a particular way of seeing environments.</p>

          <p class="chaptertitle"><strong>Doing Digital Visual Studies: An Introduction</strong></p>
          <p class="chaptersubtitle"><strong>By Laurie Gries and Aaron Beveridge</strong></p>

          <p>In the last 15 years, a number of scholarly books about visual research such as Sarah Pink’s <em>Doing Visual Ethnography</em> (2013 [2001]) and Marcus Banks’ <em>Visual Methods in Social Research</em> (2001), have emerged on the academic scene,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> marking visual methodology as a new field of study in and of itself. Sarah Pink, perhaps, describes this field of study best when she writes that the study of visual methodology entails “understanding and engaging not only with the newest and latest theoretical developments in our fields, but also with the ways that these are co-implicated with technological developments and media practices” (<em>Advances</em> 3). While content, rhetorical, and semiotic analysis have long been taken up for visual research, advancements with digital technologies are transforming even our most traditional visual research methods. Among other developments, the production of visual search engines, the proliferation of algorithms, advancements in data visualization, and innovations with digital production and recording tools are pushing the invention of new research methods such as digital ethnography (Pink 2016) and iconographic tracking (Gries 2017). When considered alongside the emergence of participatory culture and ubiquitous computing as well as responsive theories about images, materiality, space, and technology, the practice of visual research simply does not look the same as it did even 15 years ago. <em>Digital Visual Studies</em> is an edited collection that attends to such methodological shifts in both research and practice. With a targeted audience of scholars interested in visual and digital rhetoric, media studies, and visual culture, this collection specifically aims to open up new possibilities for doing digital visual research.</p>
          <p>In order to demonstrate new visual research potentials afforded by emergent technologies and media practices, we have produced <em>Doing Digital Visual Studies</em> as a digital book with eight chapters that are unique in content and multimodal format. Typically, visual methodology books survey different approaches through discussions of various visual artifacts. <em>Doing Digital Visual Studies</em> is unique in that each chapter takes up a different methodology in relation to one single image. We believe that using one visual artifact throughout book will highlight the distinctions between different methodological approaches and elucidate what each approach can uniquely bring to an object of study. We also believe that using one visual artifact can help highlight the unique affordances that engaging with the digital can bear on visual studies.</p>
          <p>The chosen image for this methodological project is Shepard Fairey’s iconic Obama Hope image, which became widely recognizable and impactful during the 2008 presidential election season (see Figure 1).</p>
          <img src="images/figure1.png" class="img-fluid rounded big-img" alt="Responsive image">
          <p class="figurecaption text-center"><b>Figure 1.</b></p>
          <p>We have chosen this image for three reasons. First, as we discuss throughout this chapter, this book project is grounded in digital experimentation; as such, we needed an image that is methodologically flexible and capable of digital play. Due to the transformative, educational, and critical nature of this digital book project, the Obama Hope image is accessible under Fair Use. It is also simple in design, making remix, 3-D printing, and glitching--the creative practices explored in the collection—both possible and manageable. Second, we felt that in order to assess the value of each included methodology, we needed deep knowledge about our chosen object of study. Laurie has been closely following and writing extensively about the Obama Hope image’s ongoing rhetorical life for 10 years (Gries 2013; Gries 2015; Gries 2017); therefore, as content editor, Laurie has a clear grasp of this image’s circulation, transformation, and rhetorical consequentiality and could thus assess each chapter’s claims about and representations of Obama Hope accordingly.</p>
          <p>Third, we needed to focus on an image that has sustained cultural relevance and is capable of educating us about contemporary new media images and practices. Due to its mass appeal and extensive involvement in helping elect the first African American president in U.S. history, the Obama Hope image has been deemed by <em>New Yorker</em> art critic Peter Schjeldahl to be the most efficacious political illustration since “Uncle Sam Wants You.” In <em>Still Life with Rhetoric</em> (2015), Laurie’s research with iconographic tracking disclosed how this single image was able to go viral and become an integral actor in the 2008 presidential election. Laurie’s research also recovered many other collective activities in which Obama Hope participated between 2008 and 2014, including, but not limited to, its participation in the Arab Spring and Occupy movements, in Greenpeace’s transnational environmental movement, and numerous political elections across the world, including the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Such research, we believe, generated many useful insights about, among other things, how viral circulation unfolds with time and space in a digitally networked global culture. Yet because Obama Hope is still circulating in the Trump presidential era and impacting culture in provocative ways (see Figure 2) and because <em>Still Life of Rhetoric’s</em> main purpose is to explicate what iconographic tracking and a new materialist approach to visual rhetoric might entail, Laurie’s work with Obama Hope in <em>Still Life with Rhetoric</em> is limited. Obama Hope still has much to teach us about visual culture and media studies, especially if studied from the diverse methodological approaches introduced in this collection and other inventive digital research methods.</p>

          <p class="figurecaption text-center"><b>Figure 2.</b></p>
          <p>In taking up Obama Hope as a single object of study, <em>Doing Digital Visual Studies</em> aims to explore how “the digital” is inflecting upon and diversifying visual studies in inventive and productive ways. We embrace the idea that visual studies is necessarily interdisciplinary--that the exploration into the interrelations between visual phenomena, visuality, vision, and culture benefits from various methodological approaches and diverse methods. We also recognize that whether taken up in anthropology, media studies, cultural studies or postcolonial studies, each discipline and field of study has something unique to offer as we explore shared questions related to the visual—what is made visible and invisible, how perspectives and communities are shaped by visual culture and vice versa, how knowing, seeing, and power are interrelated, etc. Yet we especially appreciate the work that scholars within the disciplines of Rhetoric and Composition/Writing Studies (RCWS) and Communication have brought to visual studies—from Cara Finnegan’s and Lester Olson’s studies of visual rhetorical history to Robert Hariman’s and John Lucaites’ work with photography and civic spectatorship to Sid Dobrin’s and Sean Morey’s explorations of ecosee to Kristie S. Fleckenstein’s, Sue Hum’s, and Linda T. Calendrillo’s study of shared ways of seeing and most recently Sean Morey’s and John Tinnell’s work with augmented reality. As scholars housed in these same disciplines, we aim to contribute to this ever-growing body of work by exploring how experiments with the digital can enhance our visual studies in ways that we have yet or just begun to explore.</p>
          <p>When it comes to “the digital,” we are thinking of it here in general terms as the technologies, systems, and networks that allow for new forms of storing, organizing, analyzing, and presenting information. More specifically, in relation to visual studies, we think of the digital, as Douglas Eyman defines it in <em>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method,</em> <em>Practice,</em> as a broader “organizing principle” of scholarly practice that allows for information to be “articulated and rearticulated, reshaped or recreated” in novel and generative ways (20). To distinguish digital visual studies from visual studies is to acknowledge that research unfolds differently in today’s information environment with emergent digital technologies at our disposal—in design, in implementation, in outcomes, and in presentation. Consider, for example, the following narrative told by Melissa Terras, a Digital Humanities scholar from the University College London, who paints a vivid picture of visual research pre and post digital.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>I studied Art History in my undergraduate days, and was thinking of what a career in the humanities meant to students, then. It started with the slide test, where we learnt and memorized hundreds of paintings, and were expected to be able to mobilise knowledge about them expertly. (Note – In the lecture I undertake a slide test here of Degas’ Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando, 1879, National Gallery, London). We would study 35mm slides, cramped round a slide cabinet perhaps 5 students deep, for hours, and back this up through print publications and gallery visits. If you caught the bug, you might do your undergraduate dissertation on, say, Degas and his circus paintings. You may then do a MA dissertation on the Impressionists and their circus paintings. If you were good enough, and fortunate to gain funding, you might do your PhD dissertation on the use of perspective in Degas’ circus paintings, and what this “means” for modern art. Eventually, after stiff competition, you may get a post teaching modern (used in the broadest sense) art, and your research would become highly specialised in perspective in impressionist paintings of performance. After years of hard graft you’d own this area, and write in this area, and have found and read every book and article on this area, and publish the elusive monograph in this area. You may have even travelled widely to see every painting in this area in the flesh, not to mention visiting many archives and libraries. It would take years to even piece together all the information you needed to become an expert in the field.</p>
          <p>Let’s contrast that to today’s information environment. You are not sure of the exact painting you are interested in, and rather than remember it, a quick google of “degas circus painting” leads you to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_La_La_at_the_Cirque_Fernando"><em>Wikipedia page of Miss La La</em></a>. You can find a link to it at the <a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hilaire-germain-edgar-degas-miss-la-la-at-the-cirque-fernando"><em>National Gallery</em></a>, London, where you can zoom in in so much more detail that you could ever see in a 35mm slide, or even up close when visiting the gallery. You can see where this fits in to the pantheon of Degas’ – and the Impressionists’ – oeuvre by looking up the complete works of all <a href="http://www.impressionistsgallery.co.uk/"><em>Impressionist paintings, online</em></a>. The <a href="http://www.edgar-degas.org/"><em>complete works of Edgar Degas</em></a> shows you every single known study for Miss La La, and you can see high definition images of a pastel study for the painting on the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=3697"><em>Tate website</em></a>. You can look up <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v0cqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OE8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3763,5521007&amp;dq=degas&amp;hl=en"><em>historical newspaper archives</em></a> to see if there was anything written about the painting or artist in the past, find <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/25067359"><em>relevant journal articles</em></a> that refer to the painting from the comfort of your own laptop, and see if it had been <a href="http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=%22miss+la+la%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books"><em>mentioned particularly in any book</em></a> published since the painting was painted. You could even wander up to the painting virtually using the <a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/museums/nationalgallery/"><em>Google Art Project</em></a> (well, you will be able to once the NG expand their coverage of Google Art beyond the couple of galleries that have been digitised via street view technology). You can see other’s views and visits of the artwork by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=degas%20national%20gallery%20london"><em>a simple Flickr search</em></a> (which is something art historians love, in particular, for looking at alternative views of sculptures held in museums, beyond the official viewpoint in the print catalogues). If you are in the Gallery, and want more information about a painting, you can simply take a picture on your phone, and search Google with that image, or use <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/"><em>Google goggles</em></a> to tell you more about it. (I am aware that I am mentioning Google frequently: a) I am “not-working” from home and therefore unable to easily access other institutional resources, and b) they do provide an easy suite of tools to use in the first instance, even if there are shortcomings and limitations). You can do a reverse image search using <a href="http://www.tineye.com/search/b888c0105666e52edc2e685db558b403014c8eef/"><em>Tin Eye</em></a> to see who else is talking about that image/ artwork. If you have the access, and resources, you could use <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11413&amp;page=120"><em>advanced imaging techniques</em></a> to study both the creation and the current condition of the artwork, for conservation purposes and beyond. You could use computational methods to analyse the angles and perspectives of the human figure in Degas’ artworks. You could virtually recreate the Cirque Fernando in 3D to investigate the artist’s perspective of Miss La La. If you didn’t know how to do any of this, you could ask twitter for some pointers, and within minutes someone in the DH community would have responded. Post a <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/computational-analysis-of-perspective-in-paintingsart"><em>question on DH answers</em></a>, and within 24 hours you would have the best advice on how to study perspective in modern art, using computational methods.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Now obviously, Terras here is focused on how DH research is transforming art history, a field of study with a much narrower scope of inquiry than visual studies (Dikovitskaya 147). However, the contrast articulated by Terras does a remarkable job highlighting just how vast and varied the affordances of the digital are for every stage of the visual research process. As scholars intrigued by such affordances, we aim to explore how digital technologies--social media platforms, software programs, data visualizations, mobile devices, digital archives, etc---make possible innovative ways of doing visual studies from an interdisciplinary methodological perspective. For the purposes of this collection, we call this work <em>digital visual studies</em>, which brings different methodologies to bear on a single visual object of study yet shares a commitment to engage in experimental digital-visual research.</p>
